However, it does provide an easy-to-use website and mobile app, making it appealing to people who want to interact with their insurer online.</p><h2 id=times-take>TIME's Take</h2><p>Esurance costs more than other leading car insurance companies, according to a recent review. But for drivers who prefer the convenience of interacting with their insurer through a website, mobile app, or phone—and got an Esurance policy before March 2023 (see below)—it may represent a great choice.</p><h2 id=esurances-current-business-status>Esurance’s current business status</h2><p>In 2019, Allstate, which owns Esurance, announced it would begin to retire the Esurance brand. Although the Esurance website remains operational as of July 2023, Esurance no longer sells new policies. If you attempt to get a quote on the Esurance website, you’ll be redirected to Allstate.com or another Allstate affiliate.</p><p>Allstate told us that it stopped writing new business through Esurance in March 2023, but that policies issued before that date are still being serviced. For now, at least, existing Esurance policies remain in effect.</p><p>Our Esurance review includes information gathered in mid-2023. Due to the company’s evolving business situation, some of this information may become outdated.</p><h2 id=esurance-auto-insurance-quote-comparison>Esurance auto insurance quote comparison</h2><p>Here’s how Esurance stacks up against several leading car insurers:</p><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK"><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Full Coverage</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Minimum Coverage</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Speeding ticket</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>18-year-old driver</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This information comes from a series of recent reviews by MoneyGeek and should be used for comparative purposes only. Keep in mind that the car insurance premium for an individual driver may vary from those shown here.</p><p><strong>Compare more auto insurance providers</strong></p><h2 id=how-much-is-esurance-car-insurance>How much is Esurance car insurance?</h2><p>According to recent reviews, Esurance is more expensive in many categories compared to other national insurance brands.</p><h3>Coverage type</h3><p>A full-coverage policy costs $1,473 per year with Esurance. This is slightly more expensive than a full-coverage policy from other available carriers—Progressive is the second most expensive at $1,381 per year.</p><p>A full-coverage policy typically includes state-required bodily injury and property damage liability plus optional comprehensive and collision. This level of coverage protects you financially if you’re responsible for an accident that causes injuries or damage to vehicles or other property.</p><p>A minimum-coverage policy, which includes only the state-required liability insurance, costs $901 with Esurance. Again, this is the most expensive option of several carriers reviewed. Allstate was the second-most expensive, costing $735.</p><h3>Traffic violation</h3><p>A traffic violation can cause your car insurance premium to spike. The Esurance annual premium for a driver with a speeding ticket is $1,797. This is less than Progressive's $1,964 per year, though the Esurance premium is still on the higher side of the reviewed companies.</p><h3>Age group</h3><p>Many parents know that insuring a teenager can shock a family’s budget. Teens are less experienced behind the wheel and typically don't exercise the level of judgment of more mature drivers. These factors lead to more accidents and correspondingly higher insurance costs.</p><p>The cost to insure an 18-year-old with Esurance is $6,656 per year. While the cost to insure a teen is expensive across each of the reviewed insurers, the Esurance premium is by far the highest. Progressive is the second-most expensive company for 18-year-old drivers at $5,990 per year.</p><h2 id=esurance-coverages>Esurance coverages</h2><p>Esurance offers the coverages typically required by state law. Depending on the state, these may include:</p><ul><li>Bodily injury liability.</li><li>Property damage liability.</li><li>Personal injury protection.</li><li>Uninsured/underinsured motorist.</li></ul><p>The company also offers additional coverages that a lender may require for a vehicle financed with a loan or lease:</p><ul><li>Comprehensive.</li><li>Collision.</li><li>Loan/lease (gap).</li></ul><p>Finally, Esurance offers additional, optional coverages to maximize your policy’s financial protection:</p><ul><li>Emergency roadside assistance.</li><li>Rental car coverage.</li><li>Medical payments.</li></ul><h2 id=esurance-auto-insurance-discounts>Esurance auto insurance discounts</h2><p>Unlike many insurance companies, Esurance lists only a couple of discounts on its website. And they are not always easy to find—you have to dig a little to see that the company offers a bundling discount.</p><h3>Bundling discount</h3><p>Save money by insuring both your car and home with Esurance.</p><h3>DriveSense</h3><p>DriveSense is an optional usage-based insurance (UBI) program. With DriveSense, you download a special app to your smartphone that transmits driving data in real time to Esurance. The company then uses this information to calculate a discount. Esurance does not publish the maximum available discount. It does, however, note that safer drivers have the best chance of saving money.</p><h2 id=more-about-esurance>More about Esurance</h2><p>Esurance started as an independent company in 1999 and was one of the pioneers of online car insurance policy sales. The company was bought by Allstate in 2011, partly to help it expand its appeal to customers who prefer to interact with their insurer online or by phone rather than through a local agent. The Esurance brand has always focused on fast, easy policy purchases and policy access without the support of a local agent.</p><h3>Who is Esurance best for?</h3><p>Esurance may be best for those who prefer digital interactions with their car insurance provider. Claims are reported online and the company is renowned for its speed: Esurance boasts a six-minute average quote time and a one-day claim approval rate of 69%.</p><p>Esurance’s iOS app is rated 4.8 out of 5 stars in the Apple App Store, while its Android app has a 4.3 rating in the Google Play store. The company’s website is pretty good, too. Visitors will notice its uncluttered look and feel, which contrasts with many other insurers' sites.</p><h3>Other insurance products</h3><p>Besides car insurance, Esurance has offered renters, homeowners, and motorcycle insurance policies.</p><h3>Reputation</h3><p>Esurance is not listed in JD Power’s most recent surveys of car insurance customer satisfaction or claims satisfaction. Its exclusion from this leading independent evaluation of insurers may be due to the decision by Allstate to retire the Esurance brand.</p><p>In <a rel=nofollow href=#>JD Power’s 2020 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study</a>, Esurance ranked just below the industry average. It got the same number of points as GEICO and finished ahead of brands such as Liberty Mutual and Progressive.</p><p>The company has a B rating from the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Better Business Bureau</a> (BBB). The BBB also flagged that Esurance has had a pattern of complaints relating to “calls and emails not being responded to.” These allegations were rejected by Esurance.</p><h3>Financial strength</h3><p>Esurance has an A+ (Superior) rating from A.M. Best, which indicates that the company is in excellent shape financially and capable of paying claims.</p><h3>Bottom line</h3><p>Esurance is slightly more expensive than other leading insurance companies, but may appeal to drivers who prefer to interact with their car insurer online. It’s also a name that is disappearing. Allstate is retiring the Esurance brand in 2023, so you’ll need to consider the parent company’s direct-to-consumer policy purchase options in future or look elsewhere.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do I cancel Esurance car insurance?</h3><p>You can cancel an Esurance policy by telephoning: 1-800-378-7262.</p><h3>What is cheaper than Esurance?</h3><p>According to recent reviews by MoneyGeek, Esurance’s car insurance is more expensive than many other leading brands, including GEICO, Progressive, Allstate, and State Farm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8pr%2FUq5inm5Vitq%2B%2F1KuYp5uVYr%2Bmwsiermg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fesurance-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fesurance-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fesurance-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fesurance-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fesurance-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fesurance-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1415830-matt-stonie-bio-age-height-partner-net-worth-stay-shape-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1415830-matt-stonie-bio-age-height-partner-net-worth-stay-shape-html.html>Matt Stonie bio: age, height, partner, net worth, how does he stay in shape?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1601233-corey-feldmans-net-worth-what-happened-career-wealth.html>Corey Feldman's net worth (2024): What happened to his career and wealth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1601233-corey-feldmans-net-worth-what-happened-career-wealth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
