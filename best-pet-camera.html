I’m also impressed by its sharp night vision, and how the camera reliably follows a dog as they walk around the house. Although this model is great right out of the box, its supplementary subscription service is worth considering if you want up to three days of video storage, an alert whenever your dog barks, and the ability to download pet videos to your smartphone.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 5.7 x 3 x 10.6 inches</li><li>Connectivity: iOS, Android</li><li>Integrations: Amazon Alexa</li><li>Resolution: 1080p</li><li>Field of view: 160 degrees</li><li>Subscription required: No, but available for $9.99 per month</li><li>Treat dispensing: Yes</li><li>Motion alerts: Yes</li><li>Night Vision: Yes</li><li>Price at publish: $124.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Holds 1.5 pounds of dry treats</li><li>Reliably crisp video</li><li>Loud and clear two-way audio</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Extra features locked behind a paywall</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Perfect for checking in on a lonely dog, helping to train a bored puppy, and giving your best friend a snack while you’re out.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Petcube Bites 2 Lite Smart HD Pet Camera With Treat Dispenser</a></p><h3>Best pet camera for cats: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Furbo 360° Cat Camera</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best pet camera for cats</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Furbo 360° Cat Camera</h3></p><p>While all pet cams can be used to monitor your feline friend throughout their busy day of doing nothing, the Furbo 360° Cat Camera is easily the most cat-focused model on the market today.

The Blink Mini effortlessly integrates into an Amazon Alexa-based home, where you can tell the device to activate, deactivate, begin, and stop recording via speech controls.

That is, unless you have a roaming pet cam like the EBO Air. The Air feels like a droid right out of Star Wars, as its onboard AI actively recognizes your pet and dutifully follows them around the home so you’ll always have a perfect view of whatever they’re up to. Cool sci-fi design aside, I also like the Air’s two-way audio and intuitive remote controls—via its companion app—so you can pilot the device. The Air also scores points for automatic recharging, how easily it glides over all floor surfaces, and its integrated laser pointer and top-mounted feather toy to play with your pets via Wi-Fi.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 3.74 x 3.74 x 3 inches</li><li>Connectivity: iOS/Android</li><li>Integrations: N/A</li><li>Resolution: 1080p</li><li>Field of view: 118 degrees</li><li>Subscription required: No</li><li>Treat dispensing: No</li><li>Motion alerts: Yes, automatic pet motion tracking</li><li>Night vision: Yes</li><li>Price at publish: $199.00</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Automatically follows pets</li><li>Quiet operation and easy to drive</li><li>Sharp video resolution</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>It’s easy for pet hair to clog Air’s wheels, so it’s best used on clean floors</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>You may be surprised at how much fun it is to have a robot pal in your home to monitor your pets, especially since the EBO Air is such an effective and user-friendly pet camera.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Enabot EBO Air</a></p>&nbsp;<h3>Best outdoor pet camera: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best outdoor pet camera</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus Outdoor WiFi Pet Camera, White</h3></p><p>If you need an outdoor pet cam for monitoring playtime in your yard, the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus and its wide viewing angle, two-way audio, and signature extremely bright LED lights makes it a must-buy.

There are many important aspects I considered when narrowing my list down to the greatest pet cameras you can get to day, including:</p><h3>Model’s feature list</h3><p>I considered the quality of two-way audio which allows you to both hear and talk to your pet remotely. Along with fun, yet vital, extras like treat dispensers to pamper and reward your pet; interactive toys that allow you to play with your pet while way; along with a wide field of vision so you can watch your pet even when they walk out of the video frame.</p><h3>Video resolution</h3><p>Crisp and clear video quality—indoors and outdoors—makes a big difference in user experience. I don’t recommend buying a pet camera with less than a 1080p (Full HD) resolution, so every camera on this list has 1080p or 2K resolution. As I noted above, 2K higher resolution (and higher )pet cameras offer stellar picture quality, but will usually cost you more than their Full HD counterparts.</p><h3>Smart home platform integration</h3><p>There are so many high-tech pet cameras on the market, but they will do you little good if it is not compatible with your smartphone or smart home platform. I chose cameras that are compatible with a wide variety of devices and smart home platforms so you can easily connect with what you already have.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Like many pet owners, I tend to splurge on accessories for my pets, whether it’s a decked-out pet carrier or <a rel=alternate href=#>self cleaning litter box</a>. And while higher end pet cameras offer many fun features and top-notch quality, you can still find great pet cameras without breaking the bank. I picked household and lesser-known brands in a variety of price points from $25 to $250 to meet all budgets and needs.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-pet-camera>What to consider when buying a pet camera</h2><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Since you’ll want a crisp and clear video feed when you check in on your pet, don’t settle for anything less than a 1080p (Full HD) resolution. Note that 2K and higher resolution pet cameras exist and provide a much clearer picture, but tend to be pricier than their Full HD counterparts.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>There are plenty of fun and exciting features built into the best pet cameras that you and your animal friends will appreciate. These include the ability to launch a treat to get their attention, a moving toy-on-a-string or laser pointer for entertaining cats, and a free-rolling design that will follow your pets around the house that continuously keeps tabs on them. Since each animal is different, it’s worth comparing models to find a pet camera that includes a list of features that your special puppy or kitty will get the most use from.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>No matter how many great features a pet camera may have, it’s useless to you if it’s incompatible with your smartphone or smart home platform. Ensure your pet camera will work with your devices before you buy.</p><h3>Field of view and motion detection</h3><p>When they aren’t peacefully napping, pets move from their food bowl, to their toys, to another place to snooze when you’re away, so it’s critical to find a pet camera with a wide field of view so you’ll always be able to keep an eye on them.</p><p>The best pet cameras have a 360-degree swivel feature so they can scan the entire room, as well as a continuous motion tracking feature that’ll keep its focus on your pet, ensuring that they’ll always be in view when you activate the camera.</p><h3>Two-way audio</h3><p>While it’s always nice to see your pet going about their day, nothing is as heartwarming as speaking directly to them through a pet camera’s two-way audio. It’s fun to watch and listen in as they get excited to hear your voice.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-pet-cameras-and-home-security-cameras>What is the difference between pet cameras and home security cameras?</h2><p>While some security and surveillance cameras work well as pet cameras, these two types of devices have unique features that differentiate each other:</p><p>Pet cameras are literally made to keep an eye on your animals when you’re away from home. These specialty cameras include pet-themed features such as a treat dispenser, two-way audio so you can talk to your pet while on the go, a swiveling 360-degree base so you can keep them in frame as long as they’re in the same room, and night or low-light vision so you can clearly see your pets after sundown.</p><p>On the other hand, security cameras tend to be made to withstand temperature extremes, rain, and an all-around sturdy design for easily surviving being installed outside. These cameras are often pricier than the average pet camera, but without the fun interactive features that keep animals and their owners connected like treat dispensers and laser pointers.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How much should I spend on a pet camera?</h3><p>Although pet cameras range anywhere from $30 to over $200, I recommend spending what you need to for the features you want. For instance, there are many inexpensive models on the market, but if you want to reassure your pet with your voice, give them a treat to make their day a little more fun, or a sharper resolution, it’s always worth spending extra for a superior pet monitoring system.</p><p>Generally speaking, indoor cameras tend to be more affordable than their far more durable outdoor counterparts, partly because most outdoor cameras are packed with additional security-related features and a higher video resolution.</p><h3>How do you train your pet to react to a pet camera?</h3><p>It’s easier than you may expect! Many pet cameras include two-way audio, and your loyal pet will come running when they hear your voice coming from the camera. In addition, some models include a treat container that dispenses a snack with a tap of your smartphone, making it even easier for your animal buddy to get excited to interact with your new camera. A few editions sport dangling toys, long streaming feathers, and integrated laser pointers, making them perfect for grabbing and keeping a pet’s attention.</p><h3>Are pet cameras worth it?</h3><p>The relatively low investment cost and time spent setting up a pet camera is absolutely worth the peace of mind that comes with being able to check in on your cat, dog, or other animal at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Pets get lonely when you’re gone, so the ability to see them going about their day, speak to them and watch them light up with excitement, and fling them a treat to break up the boredom of spending time without you is priceless.</p><h3>Do you need Wi-Fi for a pet camera?</h3><p>While many pet cameras use a Wi-Fi connection to livestream video to your smartphone, some models record footage on a hard drive or SD card to be viewed later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loJrBbq%2FAppyrmV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-pet-camera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-pet-camera.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-pet-camera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-pet-camera.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-pet-camera.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-pet-camera.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1426514-britt-nicoles-biography-age-height-husband-kids-net-worth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1426514-britt-nicoles-biography-age-height-husband-kids-net-worth-html.html>Britt Nicoles biography: age, height, husband, kids, net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./12-actresses-who-hid-their-pregnancies-during-filming-so-well-no-one-could-even-guess-it-814695.html>12 Actresses Who Hid Their Pregnancies During Filming So Well, No One Could Even Guess It</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./12-actresses-who-hid-their-pregnancies-during-filming-so-well-no-one-could-even-guess-it-814695.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
