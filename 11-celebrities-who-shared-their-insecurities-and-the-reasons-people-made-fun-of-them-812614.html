Jenna Ortega</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea5/532/ce16ab53989916586f586148e6.jpg><p>The lovable star recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that when she was in&nbsp;middle school, someone made fun of&nbsp;her arms, calling them “gorilla arms.” “<strong>I&nbsp;was very hairy. I&nbsp;have dark hair.</strong> I’m Latina. I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;I was insecure about my&nbsp;leg hair but my&nbsp;arm hair more. There was a&nbsp;girl who&nbsp;I was ‘friends’ with who told me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I had gorilla arms. It’s what she would call them because&nbsp;I just had really long arm hair.”</p><p>She continued saying, “So&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;sixth grade, my&nbsp;mom finally allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;shave my&nbsp;legs. When I&nbsp;came out of&nbsp;the bathroom, she realized that&nbsp;I had shaved my&nbsp;arms as&nbsp;well.” And to&nbsp;this day, Jenna shaves her arms on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis.</p><p><h2>2. Billie Eilish</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa0/f15/07722853d5a38170bf88566cfd.jpg><p>The young singer has been very <a href=#>vocal</a> about her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggles</a> to&nbsp;accept her body. “I&nbsp;love that my&nbsp;body is&nbsp;mine and that it’s with me&nbsp;everywhere I&nbsp;go. <strong>I&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;think of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body as&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend. My&nbsp;ugly friend</strong>. My&nbsp;relationship with my&nbsp;body has been a&nbsp;truly horrible, terrible thing since&nbsp;I was 11.” That’s why she opted to&nbsp;only wear baggy clothes at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her career.</p><p>“Nobody can have an&nbsp;opinion because they haven’t seen what’s underneath. No&nbsp;matter what you&nbsp;do, it’s wrong and right. Wearing baggy clothes, nobody is&nbsp;attracted to&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;feel incredibly unlovable and unsexy and not beautiful, and people shame you for not being feminine enough.”</p><p><h2>3. Gigi Hadid</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f7/8ca/d3de575b1dbc5d7744b581ba96.jpg><p>The successful model has been judged mercilessly about her appearance during her time in&nbsp;the public eye. “I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loved</a> my&nbsp;body when&nbsp;I was curvier. <strong>Then, as&nbsp;I lost&nbsp;it, people were still mean</strong>.” But it’s not all about dieting and working out for Hadid, who has been battling Hashimoto’s disease since she was 17.</p><p>“For those of&nbsp;you so&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with why my&nbsp;body has changed over the years, you may not know that when&nbsp;I started at&nbsp;17, I&nbsp;was not yet diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease.”</p><p><h2>4. Kristen Stewart</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b4/1f4/6e582354daa37fe47fa4841d86.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Despite being one of&nbsp;the most successful actresses in&nbsp;the box office this century, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Stewart</a> doesn’t love every inch of&nbsp;her body. In&nbsp;fact, there is&nbsp;one very specific thing about herself that she feels <a href=#>insecure</a> about. “I<strong>’m uncomfortable about the size of&nbsp;my&nbsp;ears</strong>, and I’m sort of&nbsp;lanky.”</p><p><h2>5. Kendall Jenner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8b/843/471cf0569eb99197e027d3bfb6.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family who is&nbsp;known for their fuller figures, Kendall surely looks different than them. “I’m constantly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>criticized</a> for being too skinny. I’m trying to&nbsp;gain weight, but my&nbsp;body won’t let it&nbsp;happen. What people don’t understand is&nbsp;that calling someone too skinny is&nbsp;the same as&nbsp;calling someone too fat, it’s not a&nbsp;nice feeling.”</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram post, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “I&nbsp;am an&nbsp;extremely lucky girl. Appreciative of&nbsp;all that I&nbsp;have. But I&nbsp;want you to&nbsp;know&nbsp;<strong>I have bad days too and that&nbsp;I hear you</strong>! You are beautiful just the way you are! It’s not always as&nbsp;perfect as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may seem.”</p><p><h2>6. Lili Reinhart</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4dd/adc/0453d652a1b6d91d6531b73864.jpg><p>A&nbsp;Twitter user once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> Lili about her co-stars on&nbsp;<i>Riverdale</i> and their really chiseled physiques. The actress answered by&nbsp;saying, “<strong>Actually, not everyone on&nbsp;this show is&nbsp;perfectly chiseled</strong>. And even&nbsp;I feel intimidated by&nbsp;the physique of&nbsp;my&nbsp;surrounding cast mates sometimes when&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;bra/underwear scenes. I’ve felt very insecure due to&nbsp;the expectation that people have for women on&nbsp;TV, what they should look like.”</p><p>She continued, “I&nbsp;have come to&nbsp;terms with my&nbsp;body and that I’m not the kind of&nbsp;person you would see walking on&nbsp;a&nbsp;runway during fashion week. I&nbsp;have bigger boobs, I&nbsp;have cellulite on&nbsp;my&nbsp;thighs/butt, and my&nbsp;stomach sticks out rather than curves&nbsp;in.”</p><p><h2>7. Taylor Swift</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65e/404/66347750e59a0fed1f512b850c.jpg><p>The <a href=#>singer</a> has been open about her struggle with food and how she has trouble seeing pictures of&nbsp;herself on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis. “There have been times in&nbsp;the past when I’ve seen a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;me&nbsp;where&nbsp;I feel like&nbsp;I looked like my&nbsp;tummy was too big, or&nbsp;someone said that&nbsp;I looked pregnant, and that’ll just <strong>trigger me&nbsp;to&nbsp;just starve a&nbsp;little bit&nbsp;— just stop eating.</strong>”</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that her “relationship with food was exactly the same psychology that&nbsp;I applied to&nbsp;everything else in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life: If&nbsp;I&nbsp;was given a&nbsp;pat on&nbsp;the head, I&nbsp;registered that as&nbsp;good. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;was given a&nbsp;punishment, I&nbsp;registered that as&nbsp;bad.”</p><p><h2>8. Jennifer Lawrence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/684/d93/0f65fb5277b2691b5b4b68dd39.jpg><p>Jordan Strauss/Invision/East News</p><p>The celebrated actress has been leading a&nbsp;very sheltered and private life over the past few years, and it&nbsp;looks like there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reason</a> for that. “You get ready in&nbsp;your hotel, and you’re like, ‘I look awesome.’ Then you walk outside, see the outfits and people who are like 7&nbsp;feet tall, and are like, <strong>‘I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;garbage. I’m not going out anymore.’</strong> I&nbsp;get very protective of&nbsp;my&nbsp;space. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that. But if&nbsp;I’m eating dinner and somebody comes&nbsp;up, and a&nbsp;flash goes off from someone’s iPhone camera, I&nbsp;am really rude to&nbsp;that person.”</p><p>She has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about her armpits and the fat that gathers when she wears gowns. “I&nbsp;know&nbsp;I have armpit fat. It’s OK.”</p><p><h2>9. Beyoncé</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4a/ab9/d705f6567fb2d542ede4a8fd2b.jpg><p>The singer has been in&nbsp;the spotlight for most of&nbsp;her life, and she knows a&nbsp;thing or&nbsp;2&nbsp;about <a href=#>insecurities</a>. While she’s made her peace with the fact that she will always be&nbsp;sweaty, with a&nbsp;runny nose when performing, there is&nbsp;something that she would gladly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change</a>.</p><p>“If&nbsp;I&nbsp;could change one part, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;my&nbsp;feet. <strong>After all the years of&nbsp;dancing, they’re a&nbsp;little beat&nbsp;up</strong>. And I&nbsp;wear big earrings because&nbsp;I don’t like my&nbsp;ears.”</p><p><h2>10. Victoria Beckham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b89/4ef/9325925693bbe328e584828475.jpg><p>The fashion designer, who used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the <i>Spice Girls, </i>has shared that there was a&nbsp;reason she used to&nbsp;wear very tight clothes. “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Looking back</a>, <strong>I&nbsp;guess it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;insecurity</strong> that&nbsp;I would always wear clothes that were very tight, very fitted. I&nbsp;remember one time at&nbsp;a&nbsp;show in&nbsp;New York where&nbsp;I wore a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;masculine trousers and trainers, and everyone went crazy, ’Oh my&nbsp;God, she’s wearing trainers.’”</p><p>But Beckham seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very careful with her image and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>limits</a> herself a&nbsp;lot when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;food. “I&nbsp;love fruit but don’t eat too much, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;can make me&nbsp;feel quite bloated.”</p><p><h2>11. Emma Chamberlain</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fe/dbb/ec931b5a569c90fe901741d404.jpg><p>The famous YouTuber has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> with body dysmorphia since she was a&nbsp;teenager. “<strong>I’ve been fully not at&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy weight</strong> and&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I was obese multiple times. It’s awful. My&nbsp;whole family was telling me&nbsp;I looked terrible. They were like, ’You look like you’re dying.’ I&nbsp;was like, ’I think&nbsp;I look great.’” And living in&nbsp;LA hasn’t been very helpful for her, since everyone seems to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;extreme diet or&nbsp;workout routine.</p><p>“Living in&nbsp;L.A., if&nbsp;you’re at&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhealthy weight, that’s normal. That’s really, really, really something to&nbsp;destroy your mind, for sure. Almost every person I’ve met has had some form of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eating disorder. I&nbsp;mean, I’ve had...I don’t want to&nbsp;trigger anyone, but so&nbsp;many.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecKeo56aop7BqrHSZq6hp12otaK%2BxJ1kraCVnr9utc2snJytop7BqrHSZpinnF2ptaZ50Z6YrKeeqHqxsc6po55lnZaxpnnFrqVmp5ZiwamxzGZvampmZoFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f11-celebrities-who-shared-their-insecurities-and-the-reasons-people-made-fun-of-them-812614.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f11-celebrities-who-shared-their-insecurities-and-the-reasons-people-made-fun-of-them-812614.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f11-celebrities-who-shared-their-insecurities-and-the-reasons-people-made-fun-of-them-812614.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f11-celebrities-who-shared-their-insecurities-and-the-reasons-people-made-fun-of-them-812614.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f11-celebrities-who-shared-their-insecurities-and-the-reasons-people-made-fun-of-them-812614.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f11-celebrities-who-shared-their-insecurities-and-the-reasons-people-made-fun-of-them-812614.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./12-actresses-who-hid-their-pregnancies-during-filming-so-well-no-one-could-even-guess-it-814695.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./12-actresses-who-hid-their-pregnancies-during-filming-so-well-no-one-could-even-guess-it-814695.html>12 Actresses Who Hid Their Pregnancies During Filming So Well, No One Could Even Guess It</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./london-s-fuzz-buzz-1117959507.html>Londons Fuzz buzz</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./london-s-fuzz-buzz-1117959507.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
