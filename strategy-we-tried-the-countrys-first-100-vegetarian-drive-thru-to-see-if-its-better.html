Restaurant chains that offer low-calorie meals — that remain convenient and affordable — <a href=# id=066d0555-55ea-59e7-9a41-b033d8604885>have sprouted across the US</a>, forcing legacy brands like Taco Bell and McDonald's to rethink their menus.</p><p>The fast-food revolution is no more apparent than in Rohnert Park, California, where a <a href=# id=24486a63-a36c-54c1-bc1a-98419d04a610>Chick-fil-A</a> sits across the street from <a href=# id=3523e3b0-3d5b-5882-95b1-35213950c744>up-and-coming </a><a href=# id=1e9ad520-f6c9-5a33-9ed7-e251690b3b63>Amy's Drive Thru</a>. On a visit to both restaurants, we found Amy's buzzing with diners long after the lunch hour.</p><p>We tried sandwiches from both Amy's and Chick-fil-A. Here's what we liked better.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On a recent visit to California's wine country, I stopped in Rohnert Park for a bite to eat.</p><p>There was no shortage of options. A highway exit off Redwood Drive offers access to Arby's, Taco Bell, Burger King, Amy's Drive Thru, Chick-fil-A, In-N-Out Burger, and El Pollo Loco.</p><p>I decided to eat at Chick-fil-A before visiting Amy's. They're located across the street from each other, and they both make sandwiches the star of the menu.</p><p>Plus, Chick-fil-A generates more revenue per restaurant than any other fast-food chain in the US — a testament to the fried-chicken chain's loyal fan base — <a href=# id=4ffe61dc-691c-593b-b619-9cda42407d40>according to QSR magazine</a>.</p><p>Within the last few years, Chick-fil-A has remodeled hundreds of stores to give them a modern farmhouse feel. The Rohnert Park location showcased that new image.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The tables were clean, but tightly packed and mostly empty.</p><p>My party of two ordered a classic Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich, a Spicy Deluxe Sandwich, Chick-fil-A Nuggets, Waffle Potato Fries, and a soft drink. The bill came out to about $19.</p><p>A restaurant employee delivered our food to our table — a nice touch.</p><p>The Chick-fil-A Nuggets were plump, with the perfect ratio of chicken to breading.</p><p>The Waffle Potato Fries did not disappoint: crunch on the outside and fluffy on the inside.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Spicy Deluxe Sandwich lit up my taste buds with a smoky chicken patty, which is hand-tossed in a hot-pepper breading. Melted pepper jack cheese doubled down on the heat.</p><p>Crisp lettuce and a thick slice of tomato delivered just the right amount of juice.</p><p>When I opened the packaging around the original Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich, I was flabbergasted by how sad it looked. A squishy bun flanked a huge piece of chicken.</p><p>There were two yellowish pickle slices, but no fresh produce or sauces. When I bit in, the flavor was bland and dry. It's worth updating to the deluxe.</p><p>The menu at Chick-fil-A sticks to what the chain does best: fried chicken. I enjoyed my entrees, but the boring Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich dampened my experience.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After stuffing our faces at Chick-fil-A, we headed to Amy's Drive Thru across the street. The property was beautiful, with a decorative water tower and a "living" roof covered in plants.</p><p>You might recognize the name Amy's from the frozen aisle at the grocery store. The company got its start in 1987 making organic and non-GMO ready-to-eat meals.</p><p>Today, Amy's frozen staples, including Cheese Enchilada, Broccoli Pot Pie, and Vegetable Lasagna, are a permanent fixture on the shelves of Whole Foods and other grocery stores.</p><p>"Over the years we felt we've been part of changing frozen food," Amy's Operations Director Paul Schiefer <a href=# id=fdf565df-06a9-5a6b-bc7c-9a0b10f2d975>told Business Insider's Kim Renfro in 2016</a>. "And we had customers and partners saying, 'Hey, I wonder if you can do the same for fast food."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The restaurant bears a striking resemblance to the remodeled Chick-fil-A locations. The barn-like design feels contemporary with fun pops of color and industrial elements.</p><p>We ordered the Amy Burger with cheese, a traditional mac and cheese, a vanilla milkshake, and a non-dairy chocolate milkshake made with soy and almond milk. It cost about $19.</p><p>The menu is 100% vegetarian, with some vegan offerings.</p><p>When we visited, nearly every table was full. We sat at a long communal table outside.</p><p>When our food was ready for pick-up at the counter, the first thing that struck me was the vibrant food packaging. Amy's partnered with "I Love Dust," an award-winning British design company known for its work with Nike, to create its whimsical stripes and dots.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The packaging was also compostable. Amy's is all about sustainability and local sourcing.</p><p>First, I dug into the traditional mac and cheese (you can also order it with broccoli or chili). The cheese tasted like the powdered kind you find in boxed macaroni. I was not impressed.</p><p>The Amy Burger includes two hockey-puck-sized vegetarian patties, two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and a "secret sauce" made regular or spicy.</p><p>This is Amy's take on the classic burger, and it blew me away. While the bean burger erred on the side of dry, it got a boost in flavor from the loads of fresh produce that filled the burger.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Look at this burger. It's huge! And at $4.99, it's no more expensive than other fast-food fare. I would gladly trade it for my usual order at a burger chain like McDonald's or Burger King.</p><p>Milkshakes sealed the deal on this tasty meal. My chocolate vegan shake was noticeably less creamy than the dairy one, but the soy and almond milks gave it a sweet, nutty flavor.</p><p>What's the verdict?</p><p>Chick-fil-A nails fried chicken like no other fast-food chain.</p><p>It's delicious with a high degree of predictability. But the basic fried-chicken sandwich could use additional produce or sauce to make the whole package more complex and less dry.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While there was one major miss among the hits I tried at Amy's, the meal overall was delightful. And that's coming from an ardent meat-lover.</p><p>I wouldn't ordinarily stop into a vegetarian restaurant, but Amy's offerings — which range from burritos to salads to burgers — didn't leave me missing meat. The meal swapped in vegetarian, organic ingredients into comfort foods that I love, making it as ethical as it was delicious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70q2pmqyVnMZwv9OrmK2dl656uLGMraminZRiwamxjJymrqakp8a0ecWiqaysXWZ9cXnVnp6erJGntqK6jJ2poq6VYsGpvtRmq6hlo5qybrXFZqCtq12XsrXAxKtmnaOUo4Wvww%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstrategy-we-tried-the-countrys-first-100-vegetarian-drive-thru-to-see-if-its-better.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstrategy-we-tried-the-countrys-first-100-vegetarian-drive-thru-to-see-if-its-better.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstrategy-we-tried-the-countrys-first-100-vegetarian-drive-thru-to-see-if-its-better.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstrategy-we-tried-the-countrys-first-100-vegetarian-drive-thru-to-see-if-its-better.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstrategy-we-tried-the-countrys-first-100-vegetarian-drive-thru-to-see-if-its-better.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstrategy-we-tried-the-countrys-first-100-vegetarian-drive-thru-to-see-if-its-better.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./americas-got-talent-judges-make-history-with-group-golden-buzzer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./americas-got-talent-judges-make-history-with-group-golden-buzzer.html>'America's Got Talent' Judges Make History with Group Golden Buzzer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-worlds-best.html>The World's Best: News, Videos &amp;amp; Recaps</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-worlds-best.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
