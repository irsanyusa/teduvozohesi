Bean bags can be dangerous and, tragically, have caused accidental deaths in past years. Nowadays, most bean bags have been updated to include safety features like double lining and double zippers. However, because bags are filled with small objects that could cause choking if ingested, your bag must be secured with a child-proof zipper or other form of closure. In addition, you want a bag with a material that is tightly stitched together so it doesn’t tear easily or preferably at all, even with rough and tumble play. If you purchase a large, heavier bag, make sure young children cannot open and get into it, which could pose a serious risk, as well, according to the <a rel=nofollow href=#>U.S. Product Safety Commission</a>.</p><p>Now, for the fun: consider your child's age and how they will enjoy the bean bag! An older child may want a flexible bag that can be used for sitting upright for reading or gaming, and a younger child may want a cozy pouf to curl up on with their stuffed animals. Consider your child’s age and size when shopping for a bean bag.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>This brings us to the size of the bean bag! Make sure to measure your space when considering a bean bag purchase, especially a larger or extra-large bag. You want to make sure there is enough space for kids to lounge comfortably or tumble around on the bags without kicking a wall. Of course, a larger bag should be fine if you are creating a cozy reading nook, but when setting up a playroom, you might want to consider the size. In addition, look at the dimensions and weight of a bean bag when shopping for one. You will likely want something your child can easily move around (the portability of bean bags is a plus for younger kids) and sit comfortably on.</p><h3>Cover material</h3><p>When shopping for a bean bag for kids, a washable cover is a must, and tear and water-resistant materials are also a good idea. Bean bags come in all kinds of covers, from cotton canvas to nylon, and fun materials like faux fur. Some brands only sell covers, so you can stuff them with whatever inner filling you prefer.</p><h3>Filling material</h3><p>Bean bags are no longer stuffed with dried beans, which were a popular filler when the bags were first created, but today, most common bean bags use styrofoam, polystyrene, or similar fillers. Unfortunately, these fillers can be toxic to pets if ingested and are not the most environmentally friendly options around. (Additionally, fillers can also present a choking and/or suffocating hazard, so be sure to make sure it is not possible for a child to access the filling.) Some fillers use recycled and biodegradable materials, like biofoam, which is non-hazardous, lightweight, and hygienic. You can stuff a bag with anything really, including recyclable clothes and shredded paper. Some bags are even made to be stuffed with clothes or soft toys and double as a storage bin!</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids>Our picks for the best bean bag chairs for kids</h2><h3>Best budget bean bag chair for kids: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mac & Milo’s Classic Refillable Bean Bag Chair</a></h3><p>We love this chair because it has a childproof zipper for safety, and you can replenish the inner material to keep the bean bag chair alive through different ages and stages.

This bean bag is engineered to accommodate any body shape because kids come in all sizes, and your teen can sit, recline, or even nap (it lays flat) on it.

We researched different types of bean bags, from chairs to chaises, and asked friends' and colleagues' kids about their personal faves. Safety, durability, price, design, and comfort for kids (and customer reviews) were all considered to create this list.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Are bean bag chairs safe for children?</h3><p>Most bean bag chairs are safe for children. There are no sharp edges, they sit low on the ground, they are soft, and some are ergonomically designed for physical comfort. Specialized bean bags can even be therapeutic and are used by pediatric occupational therapists and physical therapists in many settings. There have been instances where a bean bag accident has caused the death of a child, and many parents may not feel comfortable allowing very young children (under age 2) to play unsupervised with them. Not all bean bags are sized appropriately so the key is making sure your child is physically able to get up and down from one and that the bag has safety features like double zippers and liners. We also can’t reiterate it enough: Make sure that the bean bag you choose has <a rel=nofollow href=#>safety features</a> to prevent children from crawling inside (an entrapment and suffocation hazard) and accessing the filler (a choking and suffocation hazard).&nbsp;</p><h3>Is sitting on a bean bag good for your back?</h3><p>Yes. It is perfectly healthy for a child to sit on a bean bag. Some bags are created to be used therapeutically for positive spine alignment. Some people with lower back issues may find sitting on the right bean bag helps relieve pressure on their back and joints.</p><h3>Where is the best place to put a bean bag?</h3><p>Anywhere! Bean bags are usually pretty portable. Kids' playrooms and bedrooms are both good locations for a bean bag chair. If you want to use it indoors and outside, find a cover that is weatherproof and can stand up to sunlight.</p><h3>How long do bean bag chairs last?</h3><p>Most bean bag chairs last for up to four years, but high-end materials may last much longer. How often you use bean bags, how you use them, the weight put on them, and other daily wear-and-tear may impact your bean bag’s life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkpqur3nBmp5mm5iWtrO%2FjJ%2Bmq2WbnrG0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./courteney-cox.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./courteney-cox.html>Courteney Cox (Actress) - On This Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aziz-ansari-kanye-west-famous-music-video.html>Aziz Ansari Made a Music Video for Kanye West's &amp;quot;Famous&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aziz-ansari-kanye-west-famous-music-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
