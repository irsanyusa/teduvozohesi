The Flight Club team helped confirm the brands and styles and provided expert commentary and analysis.</p><p>We did our best to find photos of female tech executives wearing sneakers, but our search didn't yield many results. Women like Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer wore low heels, flats, or loafers, which says something about how much freedom women have to dress down in the corporate world.</p><p>If you dream of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg, lacing up a pair of these sneakers probably won't get you very far. But at least you'll look the part.</p><p>Check it out:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg: Nike Flyknit Lunar 3 in Wolf Grey</p><p>Since Nike's Flyknit franchise was introduced in 2012, Flight Club says it has seen resale values in "the hundreds, and some well over a thousand."</p><p>The Wolf Grey sneakers favored by Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, aren't currently sold in stores, but you might be able to find them on eBay.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> A similar pair costs <a href=# id=2740abbe-4aef-535f-99ea-e2c49c620406>$110</a></p><p>Satya Nadella: Lanvin Suede & Patent Leather Low-Top Sneaker</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When the Microsoft CEO took the helm in 2014, it <a href=# id=735b8e68-05b7-508c-b502-beaf3031975b>quickly became clear</a> he was stylish. So it's no surprise he opts for a more fashion-forward take on sneakers, with a pair from the French high-end brand Lanvin. Even <a href=# id=ef32d377-07c8-5c5e-802a-0f33cb0015a7>sneaker lovers on Reddit</a> have inquired about Nadella's kicks.</p><p>Sundar Pichai: Lanvin Men's Cap-Toe Leather Low-Top Sneaker</p><p>Nadella isn't the only one who likes Lanvin. Google CEO Sundar Pichai wears them too, but he prefers an all-black version.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Larry Page: Lanvin Low-Top Sneaker with Contrast Heel</p><p>Perhaps Pichai is giving fashion tips to Alphabet CEO Larry Page. Page also favors Lanvin sneakers, though his are a bit harder to find â€” the style is currently <a href=# id=1a2c9ba6-b049-57b4-b87c-209e5f3f9906>sold out</a>.</p><p>Jack Dorsey and Susan Wojcicki: Rick Owens Island Dunks and New Balance W890v4</p><p>Dorsey, Twitter's CEO, is known for having a <a href=# id=b914626d-688b-5373-a371-d5af128f3b17>more advanced fashion sense</a> than some of his Silicon Valley peers, so his sneakers by the avant-garde designer Rick Owens certainly fit his style. Owens' shoe line is something of a cult favorite in the sneaker world, but he has also <a href=# id=55106837-2dc0-5938-9ae4-665642a8d7a4>collaborated with Adidas</a> on a line.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, opted for a bright pair of New Balance running shoes to complement her athleisure look at Sun Valley in 2015.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong><a href=# id=44e4d937-96d6-5f5b-b12b-5aae4c198861>$35</a>, down from $110</p><p>Sam Altman: Puma Blaze of Glory</p><p>The president of Y Combinator is known for his casual style and penchant for wearing sneakers. In fact, he was once <a href=# id=a8575b58-c823-5992-9992-cf5acd709d38>kicked out of The Ritz London</a> for wearing his Puma Blaze of Glory shoes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here's what Flight Club says about the vibrant sneakers:</p><p>"The Puma Blaze of Glory was a retro model from the '90s that Puma has brought back with a vengeance. We've seen this model be reinvented time and time again over the last three to four years. [Puma has] sustained popularity with this model by collaborating with streetwear brands such as Kith, Alife, Stampd, Staple, Bape, Sneaker Freaker, etc. The model has been a popular sell through among a few 'sneaker heads' buying the hyped collabs."</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> These shoes can resell for $257 to $325, according to Flight Club.</p><p>Tim Cook: Nike Roshe Two Flyknit</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"For Nike, the Roshe run has performed really well over the years," the team at Flight Club says. "It was first spotted overseas in Asia, and then it hit the States in 2012. We have witnessed the Roshe run sell by the hundreds in the secondary market ranging from $109 to $300, depending on popularity. The demand for this model and return upon investment are undeniable."</p><p>Flight Club says the most popular colors for Roshe Runs are Triple Red, Calypso, GPX Tiger Camo Pack, Yeezy, Rainbow, and Santa Monica Pier.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> The original pair is sold out, but you can get V2 for <a href=# id=224617d8-f725-50ac-9909-108eb3f7ebbc>$50</a>, down from $130</p><p>Here's Cook in another pair of Nike shoes.</p><p>Cook was spotted in Nike Roshe Ones at the grand opening of an Apple Store in Palo Alto, California.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>MacKenzie and Jeff Bezos: Ash Bowie Wedge Sneaker and Converse Jack Purcell Low-Top</p><p>Novelist MacKenzie Bezos favors wedge-heeled sneakers by Ash, while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wears more affordable Jack Purcells.</p><p>"Converse has stepped up the model by doing cool collabs with men's contemporary brands like rock designer John Varvatos, Neighborhood, WTAPS, and Comme des Garcons. Also, let's not forget the annual Missoni collab," Flight Club says. "For those interested in finding rare, dope spins on this model, we've seen the best executions of these models come out of Japan."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Daniel Ek: Nike Air Force 1 '07</p><p>"Over the years, the model has become iconic and part of the very fabric that makes Nike so great," Flight Club says. "The Air Force franchise has left a historic impression not only on sports culture, but it has been a hands-down pop-culture staple. Throughout the '90s and early 2000s, Air Forces have been a staple in streetwear fashion â€” especially the beloved white-on-whites."</p><p>While Ek sports the basic version of the shoe, Flight Club says it has seen high-end and rare versions of Air Force 1s "flip for the thousands."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Ek is clearly a fan of white sneakers â€” he has also been spotted in a pair of Adidas' best-known shoes.</p><p>Ek is wearing Adidas Superstar Shoes.</p><p>Evan Spiegel: Common Projects Original Achilles Leather Sneakers</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Spiegel, CEO of Snap, is a longtime fan of the high-end sneaker brand Common Projects. In fact, he <a href=# id=a6a076a4-141e-51ba-b222-c0d6ae262b0f>told GQ</a> he has worn the brand since high school. But they don't come cheap â€” an average pair of Common Projects costs $400, according to Flight Club.</p><p>"The all-white pair of Achilles is the most popular colorway for the brand," Flight Club says. "Some may ask why would you pay so much for such a simple shoe. The answer: craftsmanship. These shoes are hand-stitched and usually made out of Italian leather. Also, they look great with your everyday look."</p><p>Kevin Systrom: Lanvin Classic Leather & Suede High-Top Sneakers</p><p>Systrom, Instagram's CEO, is a yet another tech CEO who favors Lanvin shoes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is known for his eye-catching shoe choices.

"Plus, it reminds me that we're fighting for the end user â€” the consumer â€” because they wear sneakers, too!"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Levie favors Asics shoes, like these Onitsuka Tiger sneakers. Onitsuka Tiger is an Asics label that focuses on a more vintage style, according to Flight Club. While Levie's blue and orange pair is sold out, other colors are still available.</p><p><strong>Price: </strong>You can't buy Levie's exact pair, but a similar shoe will cost you <a href=# id=c94fce3d-e6a1-5056-a183-9fc0bd57bcd4>$90</a></p><p>Brian Chesky: Gucci Ace Leather Low-Top Sneaker</p><p>Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, is another stylish exec, and he often chooses unique â€” and expensive â€” footwear.

His fringed high-tops are <a href=# id=c5820984-d453-5e64-bc4d-f35738c524b1>sold out on Saint Laurent's site</a>, but you can likely still find them on eBay or buy the gray version on <a href=# id=e24e51f0-2aa6-55aa-a04d-b0bede157601>Spring</a>.</p><p>Elon Musk: Nike Lunar Flyknit HTM NRG</p><p>It's hard to be sure, but Business Insider and Flight Club think Musk, the Tesla CEO, is wearing the Nike Lunar Flyknit HTM NRG, a shoe created by the renowned <a href=# id=069490e7-ea9c-59d2-899d-0a1089ae6a08>design trio</a> of Hiroshi Fujiwara, Tinker Hatfield, and Mark Parker.
