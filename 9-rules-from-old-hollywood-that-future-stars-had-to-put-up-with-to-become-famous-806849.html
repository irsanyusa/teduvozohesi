<time>28 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The lives of&nbsp;celebrities of&nbsp;the Golden Age of&nbsp;Hollywood only seem perfect. Behind the glamour, there’s a&nbsp;harsh truth about the difficult conditions of&nbsp;the contracts the actors had to&nbsp;follow to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful. Studio bosses often had full power over the stars, leaving them no&nbsp;choice. This was the price of&nbsp;the actors’ fame.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have found out what requirements there were for the stars of&nbsp;old Hollywood. And many of&nbsp;them would cause a&nbsp;huge scandal if&nbsp;they existed today.</p><p><h2>Actors were loaned out.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfb/1e0/6ee62e512ea4303c530426bdee.jpg><p>After signing a&nbsp;multi-year contract with a&nbsp;studio, movie stars didn’t belong to&nbsp;themselves anymore. Hollywood bosses decided what films and what roles the actors would get. More than that, studios often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>borrowed</a> actors from each other for movies. <strong>And the more famous the name of&nbsp;the star was, the more expensive the “rent” was.</strong></p><p>After the success of&nbsp;<i>Hell’s Angels</i>, Howard Hughes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> Jean Harlow to&nbsp;other studios. Columbia Pictures <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>borrowed</a> Clark Gable from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Also, MGM rented out <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lana Turner</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Joan Crawford</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hedy Lamarr</a>, and other rather famous actors and actresses.</p><p><h2>Actors were forced to&nbsp;use stage names.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0a/a6e/e51b1157be9c3219eb0625ab02.jpg><p>The rising stars of&nbsp;old Hollywood often stopped using their real names, but not because they wanted&nbsp;to. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Natalie Wood</a>&nbsp;— these are the names that actresses became famous with worldwide. And <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Carole Lombard</a> (born Jane Alice Peters) had to&nbsp;change her first and last name due to&nbsp;her contract conditions.</p><p>Another famous actress was even less lucky. The studio boss thought that the real name of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Joan Crawford</a> sounded like “<strong>sewer</strong>.” The company even conducted a&nbsp;vote to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;stage name for her. The actress <strong>hated her new name for the rest of&nbsp;her life</strong>, but admitted that she felt safer with&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Their past and their image were made&nbsp;up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/389/183/2bf4f051099e4150ef63b3a1e0.jpg><p>In&nbsp;old Hollywood, actors were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>often</a> told to&nbsp;change facts about their past. The stars had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;against their own nature and character, and they didn’t always like&nbsp;it.</p><p>Joan Crawford grew in&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;problematic family, but thanks to&nbsp;MGM, she became the daughter of&nbsp;typical rich Americans. It&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she’d gotten tired of&nbsp;the rich life and run away to&nbsp;Hollywood. Rita Hayworth often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> she was the exact opposite of&nbsp;the character she had to&nbsp;portray. Cary Grant <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> about himself, <strong>“Everyone wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Cary Grant—even I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Cary Grant.”</strong></p><p><h2>They were forced to&nbsp;be&nbsp;polite with the press.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc9/f8e/41c9335d62af98132eb7cf2496.jpg><p>Movie stars had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>please</strong></a><strong> journalists and be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;pose when they were asked&nbsp;to</strong>. But not everyone followed this rule. Once, Katharine Hepburn, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>famous</a> for her explosive temper, snatched a&nbsp;camera from the hands of&nbsp;a&nbsp;reporter who took a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;her without her permission.</p><p><h2>Actors’ self-esteem was lowered.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59c/522/d033065ad2b55b46920c525f76.jpg><p>Studio bosses weren’t very kind to&nbsp;actors and actresses. And it&nbsp;seems that they made some stars feel insecure on&nbsp;purpose. <strong>The head of&nbsp;MGM </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>called</strong></a><strong> Judy Garland “little hunchback.”</strong> The young actress didn’t fit in&nbsp;with the glamour image of&nbsp;the time and was very shy about her appearance.</p><p>Even when she turned into a&nbsp;beautiful young woman, Judy still <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> the “girl next door” image. She wore special rubber discs to&nbsp;correct the shape of&nbsp;her nose and accessories on&nbsp;her teeth. Later, a&nbsp;studio makeup artist helped her get rid of&nbsp;all this, but her self-esteem didn’t get much better.</p><p><h2>The actress’s appearance was used.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/601/ec9/2b768e5a3c8e4372bf0c2a3235.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was very different with actresses that were obviously very attractive. Studio bosses tried to&nbsp;attract as&nbsp;much attention to&nbsp;their body parts as&nbsp;possible. So, Betty Grable, was famous for her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>perfect</a> legs that 20th Century Fox <strong>insured for a&nbsp;huge sum of&nbsp;money just for&nbsp;PR purposes</strong>. The entire world talked only about Betty’s legs.</p><p>Hedy Lamarr was also partially a&nbsp;hostage of&nbsp;her own appearance. The head of&nbsp;MGM was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>promoting</a> her as&nbsp;the most beautiful woman in&nbsp;the world. He&nbsp;had high hopes because of&nbsp;how attractive she was. Of&nbsp;course, she only portrayed exotic characters that wanted to&nbsp;seduce men.</p><p><h2>Actors were forced to&nbsp;fake relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afb/a4c/b989d6510b836799da91df3c82.jpg><p>Movie companies often <strong>used fake relationships between actors</strong> to&nbsp;attract viewers’ attention to&nbsp;movies. For example, Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supported</a> the illusion of&nbsp;a&nbsp;romance in&nbsp;public because the fans loved the “chemistry” between them. Judy really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fell in&nbsp;love</a> with Mickey, but Rooney <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that they were connected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;feeling more than love.</p><p><h2>The personal lives of&nbsp;actors were controlled.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f54/d81/374f56578b901cbbe6a53f6af4.jpg><p><a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor" data-link=tag>Elizabeth Taylor</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that the movie studio controlled all aspects of&nbsp;her life, and this was especially true for her relationships. The MGM bosses <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>organized</strong></a><strong> a&nbsp;meeting between 16-year-old Elizabeth and football player Glenn Davis</strong>. They were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>engaged</a> for one month, but the wedding never happened.</p><p>When the actress was&nbsp;18, she was going to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marry</a> Conrad Nicholson Hilton, and MGM decided to&nbsp;organize the wedding to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;media event. The marriage didn’t last long, but it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>promotion</a> for the movie <i>Father of&nbsp;the Bride</i>, which Taylor was&nbsp;in.</p><p>The movie studios made sure that personal relationships didn’t affect the image of&nbsp;the stars. When Mickey Rooney said he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;marry Ava Gardner, <strong>the MGM boss spoke </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>against</strong></a><strong> this marriage</strong>. But later, the actors still had a&nbsp;small celebration.</p><p>Judy Garland also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disobeyed</a> her bosses and married musician David Rose, even though the studio was against&nbsp;it. For this, the bosses told her to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;the set within 24&nbsp;hours after the wedding, depriving the newlyweds of&nbsp;their honeymoon.</p><p><h2>Actors were told what they should look like.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d58/b2d/01f64153c6b3c9ece707a6ef63.jpg><p>Columbia Pictures was making a&nbsp;contract with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>, and they based her appearance on&nbsp;Rita Hayworth. A&nbsp;starlet that had chestnut hair became a&nbsp;platinum blonde <strong>because the studio said&nbsp;so</strong>. Besides, she also had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>undergo</a> the procedure of&nbsp;hairline electrolysis to&nbsp;change her hairline.</p><p>Even children couldn’t avoid appearance requirements. For example, MGM <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor wear braces and got her to&nbsp;remove 2&nbsp;baby teeth. The studio also wanted to&nbsp;dye her hair, change the shape of&nbsp;her eyebrows, and name her Virginia, but her parents, and Elizabeth herself, were strongly against that.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think you could meet these requirements just to&nbsp;be&nbsp;world-famous? Which of&nbsp;these things seem the most outrageous to&nbsp;you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuvtSlnKxllqe8rnnOpZtmoJ%2BhubrDzqibZqyYlsFustStrKudXajBor7SZp%2BanF2pvG681K1krqhdrLa1tIytpmaalZi8rrGMn5imp6Woenl8lXFrcmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f9-rules-from-old-hollywood-that-future-stars-had-to-put-up-with-to-become-famous-806849.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f9-rules-from-old-hollywood-that-future-stars-had-to-put-up-with-to-become-famous-806849.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f9-rules-from-old-hollywood-that-future-stars-had-to-put-up-with-to-become-famous-806849.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f9-rules-from-old-hollywood-that-future-stars-had-to-put-up-with-to-become-famous-806849.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f9-rules-from-old-hollywood-that-future-stars-had-to-put-up-with-to-become-famous-806849.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f9-rules-from-old-hollywood-that-future-stars-had-to-put-up-with-to-become-famous-806849.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ashley-graham-named-worlds-sexiest-woman-in-2023-and-other-beauties-who-made-the-list-812760.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ashley-graham-named-worlds-sexiest-woman-in-2023-and-other-beauties-who-made-the-list-812760.html>Ashley Graham Named Worlds Sexiest Woman in 2023, and Other Beauties Who Made the List</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./southwest-fine-airplane-delays.html>Southwest Airlines Pays Record Fine For Keeping Passengers on Tarmac</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./southwest-fine-airplane-delays.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
