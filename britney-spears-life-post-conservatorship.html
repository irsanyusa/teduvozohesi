She also released a collaboration with will.i.am dubbed "Mind Your Business" in July.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Page Six</a> has since reported that Britney is planning to record a new album and is "getting songs from some big artists." However, there has been no confirmation of this from Britney herself.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Pregnancy and miscarriage</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After testifying in June 2021 that, under the conservatorship, she'd been prevented from removing an IUD that kept her from having another baby, Britney shared on <a href=#>Instagram</a> in April 2022 that she was pregnant with her and Asghari's first child together. In the post, she revealed that she had suffered from perinatal depression while pregnant with her first two children, sons Sean Preston and Jayden James, who she shares with her ex-husband Kevin Federline.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"Women didn't talk about it back then … some people considered it dangerous if a woman complained like that with a baby inside her," she wrote. "But now women talk about it everyday … thank Jesus we don't have to keep that pain a reserved proper secret."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In May 2022, she and Asghari released a <a href=#>joint statement on Instagram</a> announcing that Britney had a miscarriage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that we have lost our miracle baby early in the pregnancy," the statement read. "This is a devastating time for any parent. Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along however we were overly excited to share the good news."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Marriage and separation</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On June 9, 2022, about a month after Britney publicly shared the news of her miscarriage, she and Asghari tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at their Los Angeles home. None of Britney's family members, including her children, were in attendance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Aug. 16, 2023, a little over 14 months after they were married, Asghari submitted a divorce filing to Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences as legal grounds for the divorce. According to the filing, the couple had separated on July 28.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Three days later, Britney confirmed the split in a post on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“As everyone knows, Hesam and I are no longer together … 6 years is a long time to be with someone so, I’m a little shocked but … I’m not here to explain why because its honestly nobody’s business," she wrote. “But, I couldn’t take the pain anymore honestly !!! In some sort of telepathic way I have been receiving so many messages that melt my heart from friends and I thank you !!! I’ve been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it’s far from reality and I think we all know that !!!"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Relationship with her children</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ahead of Britney and Asghari's wedding, Federline's attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told <a href=#>People</a> that Sean and Jayden didn't want to distract from Britney's big day by attending the ceremony.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"They're happy for their mom, and they are hopeful that Sam and Britney are starting a great future together," Kaplan said. "It's their night, and they didn't want to take away from them."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A public back-and-forth involving Britney, Federline, and their two teenage sons, now 18 and 17, ensued, sparking speculation over the state of Britney's relationship with her kids. In August 2022, Federline told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> that the boys had cut off contact with Britney over how she used social media. Jayden gave his own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with ITV News in September 2022, in which he criticized Britney's Instagram presence and defended Jamie's role in the conservatorship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I 100% think this can be fixed. It’s just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better I really want to see her again,” Jayden said. "I love you a lot, I hope for the best for you. Maybe one day we can sit down like this and talk again."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Britney initially responded to Jayden's interview in an audio recording on Instagram, accusing him of disrespecting her and of being angry that he would stop receiving child support payments when he turned 18. She later deleted the clip and posted a series of new recordings in which she spoke about how painful the conflict with her sons had been.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"Since they’ve been gone, I’ve honestly felt like a huge part of me has died," she said. “All I know is that my love for my children is more than anything and I’m sorry if I ever hurt you guys in any way. I was told you guys have blocked me. But I will speak here. … I’m so blessed to even call you mine, and I just want you to know I apologize."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A few months later, on her 41st birthday, Britney shared an emotional tribute to her sons on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. "To both of my boys … I love you … I would die for you," she wrote. "God speed my precious hearts !!! I would give anything just to touch your face !!! I send my love … Mamasita."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sean and Jayden have since moved to Hawaii with Federline, his wife Victoria, and their daughters Jordan and Peyton. "It’s an opportunity for Kevin and his wife," Kaplan told <a href=#>People</a> of the move. "And the boys are ready to get away from the L.A. microscope."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2FsgXmCjpupoqyemsZuv8%2BemKurXaG2p7GMqaasrF2YvK%2B%2FxKutmqyfp8Cptc9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-life-post-conservatorship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbritney-spears-life-post-conservatorship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-life-post-conservatorship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbritney-spears-life-post-conservatorship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-life-post-conservatorship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-life-post-conservatorship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10-cartoon-houses-that-were-built-in-real-life-642910.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10-cartoon-houses-that-were-built-in-real-life-642910.html>10Cartoon Houses That Were Built inReal Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./consequences-de-la-crise-sur-la-fiscalite-locale-les-premieres-estimations-de-bercy.html>les premires estimations de Bercy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./consequences-de-la-crise-sur-la-fiscalite-locale-les-premieres-estimations-de-bercy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
