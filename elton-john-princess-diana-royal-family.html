In <a href=#><i>Me</i>, his newly published autobiography</a>, John shows that his interest goes beyond the imaginary: he had many strange and fascinating interactions with members of the royal family over the years, from Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to Princess Diana. His writing breathes humanity into a family almost always shrouded in rigid formality.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">John’s relationship with the royal family began in the ’70s, when he was invited for dinner at Kensington Palace by Princess Margaret, who was a huge fan of music and musicians. But the dinner quickly devolved into a scene of marital strife between Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, who would divorce in 1978. “He stormed in midway through the meal and literally snarled ‘Where’s my f-cking dinner?’ at her,” John writes. “They had a huge row, and she fled the room in tears.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">John’s growing stature in British culture — combined with the fact that he lived close to Windsor Castle — made his royal interactions more and more frequent. In the late ’70s, Prince Philip made fun of the bright yellow Aston Martin that John frequently drove around the neighborhood: “Makes you look like a bloody fool. Get rid of it.” The Queen Mum came over for a meal, after which they danced to her favorite record, an old Irish drinking song called “Slattery’s Mounted Fut.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">John had an even more memorable encounter with the Queen Mum’s daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, of whom John says, “In private, she could be hilarious.” At Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle, John watched her reprimand the Viscount Linley about a familial matter: “The Queen lightly slapped him across the face, saying ‘Don’t’ — SLAP — ‘argue’ — SLAP — ‘with’ — SLAP — ‘me’ — SLAP — ‘I’ — SLAP — ‘am’ — SLAP — ‘THE QUEEN!’” John writes that when the Queen saw him watching, she winked at him before moving on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the most meaningful royal relationship John had was with <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. The pair met at the same party, and John immediately felt a kinship. “She was blessed with an incredible social ease, an ability to talk to anybody, to make herself seem ordinary,” he writes. He did notice, however, that despite her disdain of royal formality, she maintained a distant and frosty relationship with her husband, Prince Charles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the pair spent more time together, John many times bore witness to what he termed as the “Diana Effect” on men. At one dinner party, he observed as Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone both became smitten by her and then nearly fought each other before getting disentangled, with Gere prevailing and Stallone storming off. “I never would have come if I’d known Prince f-ckin’ Charming was gonna be here,” John remembers Stallone grumbling. “If I’d wanted her, I would’ve taken her!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She could bring Hollywood superstars to the verge of a punch-up over her attentions at a dinner party, like a couple of love-struck teenager idiots,” John writes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The pair fell out after Diana dropped out of writing the foreword to a rock photography book that gave its proceeds to the AIDS Foundation. “I think Buckingham Palace didn’t like the idea of a member of the royal family having anything to do with a book that featured shots of naked guys with towels draped around them,” John writes. They reconciled at Gianni Versace’s funeral — but it was to be the last time they saw each other, as Diana died in a car crash a few weeks later.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At Diana’s funeral, John sang a new version of “Candle in the Wind” with reworked lyrics by his <a href=#>writing partner Bernie Taupin</a>. (“You called out to our country, and you whispered to those in pain,” the lyrics went.) When he recorded it, the song became an international bestseller, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But John wasn’t happy with the song’s success. “Why would anyone want to listen to it?” he writes. “It seemed unhealthy to me: morbid and unnatural. I really didn’t think it was what Diana would have wanted.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">John’s relationship with the family continues up through the present day. In April, he defended the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after they were <a href=#>publicly criticized for using</a> a private plane. “I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote on Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZub2BmfneFjp6jraeeYrewtM1mp6uhnpiytL%2BMnaCappFiv7DFwKVkn5mdnrm6ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felton-john-princess-diana-royal-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2felton-john-princess-diana-royal-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2felton-john-princess-diana-royal-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2felton-john-princess-diana-royal-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felton-john-princess-diana-royal-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2felton-john-princess-diana-royal-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fpic-baisse-des-dotations-communes-nouvelles-la-commission-des-finances-du-senat-se-demarque-peu-de.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fpic-baisse-des-dotations-communes-nouvelles-la-commission-des-finances-du-senat-se-demarque-peu-de.html>Fpic, baisse des dotations, communes nouvelles... la commission des finances du Snat se dmarque</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1599816-burna-boy-london-stadium-sabinus-opens-show-seyi-vibez-phyno-omah-lay-perform.html>Burna Boy at London Stadium: Sabinus Opens Show, Seyi Vibez, Phyno, Omah Lay, Others Perform</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1599816-burna-boy-london-stadium-sabinus-opens-show-seyi-vibez-phyno-omah-lay-perform.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
