This has never been done on the show before.</strong></p><p>This week’s episode also featured some other memorable auditions, both good and bad. One performance had the judges totally split, while others made them emotional. Auditions are winding down, and it won’t be long before the next round of the competition starts.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-america-s-got-talent-judges-split-on-weird-act>‘America’s Got Talent’ Judges Split on Weird Act</h2><p>Alex Ostrovskiy inspired some very different reactions from the four America’s Got Talent judges this week. The performer appeared in a top hat and white wings. He glided around the stage playing the trumpet to “Greatest Love of All” by Whitney Houston. It didn’t sound great.</p><p>His trumpet had its own flapping wings, and at one point it started flying around the stage. Alex added even more trumpets into the mix, with several swinging around him in midair. Howie Mandel and Simon Cowell were impressed, but Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara buzzed the act.</p><p>It was a complicated act to judge. While the music wasn’t particularly good, the flying trumpets were a cool effect, and something we haven’t seen before on the show. Mandel and Cowell voted yes, and they tried to coax Vergara into joining them. However, she just couldn’t get behind the act, meaning Alex was eliminated.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>SIMON COWELL SAYS HE’S JUST LIKE HEIDI KLUM THIS SEASON ON ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-man-sings-emotional-tribute-to-his-late-wife>Man Sings Emotional Tribute to His Late Wife</h3><p>The most emotional audition of the night came from <a href=#>Matt Mauser</a>, a dad of three from California. His wife Christina was a girl’s basketball coach who passed away in the same helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant last year. After sharing his story, Matt sang a moving rendition of “Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)” by Phil Collins.</p><p>The singer broke down at the end of the song. All four judges gave him a standing ovation, with Klum calling the performance “very special.” Mandel told Matt of his wife, “You are her legacy. This moment is her legacy.” Before tonight’s show, we thought that <a href=#>maybe Matt would receive</a> the much-hyped group Golden Buzzer. That didn’t end up happening, although he did get four “yes” votes from the judges to move on to the next round.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mother-shoots-arrows-at-her-daughter-in-danger-act>Mother Shoots Arrows at Her Daughter in Danger Act</h3><p>Another memorable performance that had the judges slightly divided came from a <a href=#>mother and daughter danger act</a>. Mom Gigi Deluxe shot arrows at her 20-year-old daughter Devon, popping balloons in her mouth and aiming at a board just inches from her body.</p><p>Cowell called it “one of the nuttiest acts” he’s seen on the show, due to the fact that it was a mother shooting at her child. Mandel, however, thought it “didn’t have the energy that I wanted it to have,” voting no. Cowell agreed that they needed to “put on more of a show,” but he voted yes, along with Vergara and Klum.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-young-opera-singer-on-america-s-got-talent-earns-group-golden-buzzer>Young Opera Singer on ‘America’s Got Talent’ Earns Group Golden Buzzer</h3><p>The group Golden Buzzer came at the very end of the show, as 9-year-old Victory Brinker showed off her incredible voice as an opera singer. Before performing, she told Cowell that she would buy him a more colorful shirt if she wins the show. He was amused by her comment.</p><p>The judges were clearly wowed by Victory’s performance, but what made it even more special was that a bird had gotten into the auditorium. It landed on the stage after Victory sang, prompting Klum to call it “a sign.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>SINGER SURPRISES SIMON COWELL WITH HUGE VOCAL RANGE ON ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><p>The group Golden Buzzer appeared to be Cowell’s idea, as he called host Terry Crews down to the judges’ table for a discussion. He then faked Victory out by making it seem like they weren’t going to accept her. That’s when the five of them hit the Golden Buzzer for her at the same time.</p><p>Victory is very talented, and it’s cool to see the show trying something new. However, this just brings the total number of singing acts who have earned the Golden Buzzer this season up to four out of six. What do you think? Would you have hit the Golden Buzzer for Victory?
