While popular dishes of the past included <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sauerbraten </a>(marinated, braised beef), roulades, Eisbein (stewed knuckle of pork) and Schweinshaxe (roast pork joint), German food nowadays looks very different thanks to international influence.</p><p>Indeed <a href=#>Turkish döner kebab</a>, Vietnamese pho, Russian Soljanka and Greek gyros are now as popular throughout much of the country as any old-fashioned German dishes.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past few years, a cooking fever has broken out in Germany and people love to cook at home and with friends.</p><p>As many Germans are adopting vegetarian and health-conscious diets they are also reinterpreting those traditional German dishes that were heavy in meat and dairy, and leaning more towards meat alternatives and flavorful salads.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Sausages>1.
