The big game also showcases America’s<a href=#> most expensive commercials</a> expected to reach millions of eyeballs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It helps that Chiefs player Travis Kelce’s girlfriend,<a href=#> TIME Person of the Year</a> Taylor Swift,<a href=#> has brought an economic boost and new fan base</a> to the already lucrative franchise. Fans can expect to <a href=#>shell out more than $12,000 on average</a> for a ticket to this year’s Super Bowl, but advertisers are pulling out even greater bucks, with a 30-second ad during the game costing $7 million. The cost was the same last year, but is double the price it was in 2012, <a href=#>according to Statista</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With 115 million viewers<a href=#> watching the big game last year</a> and<a href=#> even more expected this</a> time around, advertisers are putting their best foot forward.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here is our best and worst round-up of the Super Bowl LVIII ads.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Most heartwarming: </strong><strong>Cetaphil on the ‘Taylor Swift effect’</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Skincare brand Cetaphil released an ad highlighting how Swifities’ interest in football has brought daughters and dads together. While the commercial does not explicitly mention Taylor Swift, the teen wears <a href=#>colorful friendship bracelets</a> that fans trade at the artist’s concerts. Eventually, the young girl accepts the number 13 jersey her father offers to her—13 is Swift’s favorite number—and sits down with him to watch the NFL game on the couch, having previously been tucked away in her room.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end viewers see the girl give her father a gift of her own, a bracelet that reads “Dad, I love [you].”</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most star-studded: Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, the Beckhams, and Usher for Uber Eats</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Food delivery service Uber Eats brought in strong talent for their commercial on the theme of forgetfulness. The ad starts with Jennifer Aniston receiving a bag of groceries from an assistant on set. “You know what they say, in order to remember something, you have to forget something else,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The forgotten thing in question ends up being her Friends co-star and colleague of ten years, David Schwimmer, who tries and fails to greet his old friend. But Ross and Rachel aren’t the only power couple to feature in the ad.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">David and Victoria Beckham also appear. Their son Brooklyn Beckham <a href=#>recently launched a pop-up restaurant</a> with the company in London.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As if there weren’t enough celebrity cameos, Rapper Jelly Roll can’t remember his own face tattoos and the ad ends with Usher—who is due to perform during Sunday’s halftime show—saying, “I hope I get to play a half-time show some day, man.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The campaign concludes with the message: “Whatever you forget, remember, Uber Eats gets anything.”</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a Super Bowl ad teaser, released before the full commercial, the Beckhams poked fun at a <a href=#>viral scene</a> from David’s <a href=#>Netflix documentary</a>, where Victoria said their families were “very working class” before her husband told her to “be honest” about which car her dad drove her to school in—a Rolls Royce.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Victoria, wearing a shirt that read “My Dad Had a Rolls Royce,” said they were starring in a “little” commercial. David told her to “be honest” that it’s for the Super Bowl, although the British couple pretended to get confused whether it’s for baseball or hockey.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Social media users in comments <a href=#>on Instagram</a> loved the teaser, calling it hilarious.</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most self-deprecating: Ben Affleck for Dunkin’ Donuts</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ben Affleck poked fun at himself being called bored at the 2023 Grammys for the Dunkin’ Donuts Super Bowl ad. His wife Jennifer Lopez shared the clip to her <a href=#>Instagram account</a> with a single donut emoji.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ad follows Affleck as he tries to appear less bored by launching a music career to keep up with his wife. "He's bored? No. He's studying, always watching. I can do that. How hard can it be?" he asks while sipping Dunkin’ coffee. He even coins his own rival nickname BLo, before acknowledging it’s bad.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The actor meets up with influencer Charli D’Amelio, who is unfamiliar with who Affleck is, but does know of Lopez.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following a montage of his efforts to become a musical sensation, the ad ends with Affleck placing a donut necklace on and saying: “They tell you you’re no good. You're a goofy, middle-aged, clumsy white guy with no rhythm and you can't sing on key, you're not coordinated. That means I can't be a pop star? Underestimate Boston, mmm, at your peril.”</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most cross-generational: Christopher Walken, Usher, and Ashley Park for BMW.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In their 60-second Super Bowl commercial titled “Talkin’ Like Walken,” BMW invites stars such as Usher and Emily in Paris actress Ashley Park to do their best impression of Christopher Walken’s distinct voice. Walken grows tired of the impressions from his hotel valet, tailor, makeup artist, and barista before he encounters this year’s half-time show performer Usher.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Don’t you got somewhere to be?” Walken asks Usher, who nods to one of his biggest hits of the same name when he answers, "Yeah.” Walken then drives off, dismissing imitations in life and the automobile industry.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Most bizarre: Knuckles, Drew Barrymore, and others for Paramount+&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A commercial for Paramount+ features a range of stars, including Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Patrick Stewart, Drew Barrymore, Dora, and even Knuckles (Idris Elba) from Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Onlookers are hoping to reach the top of a mountain, prompting Tagovailoa to say that he could do so if he were a football. But in the absence of the actual ball, Stewart decides to throw Arnold, the lead character from the ‘90s television series Hey Arnold! who happens to have a football-shaped head, up the mountain. American rock band Creed then performs, and Stewart sings along, as everyone then watches Arnold fall short of reaching the top of the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A mountain of entertainment,” the ad says at the end, referencing the streaming service.</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most random: Jason Momoa, Zach Braff,and Donald Faison for T-Mobile</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">T-Mobile has returned with its eleventh Super Bowl ad featuring former Scrubs co-stars Zach Braff and  Donald Faison. The 60-second clip shows the comedic duo knocking on Marvel star Jason Momoa’s front door for a party that is canceled due to internet cable issues. The three men launch into a musical number about T-Mobile’s Wi-Fi services, which sees Momoa do a backflip and stand beneath pouring water.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Actor Jennifer Beals also makes a guest appearance to tell Momoa, “Do it again with your shirt off,” before telling Braff and Faison not to take theirs off.</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most meme-able: Cardi B for NYX</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">NYX teased their Super Bowl ad, which riffs on Cardi B’s viral “That’s Suspicious” moment that became a popular TikTok sound. The makeup brand premiered a 15-second clip where Cardi B tries on their new shade of Duck Plump lip gloss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The rapper says, “NYX Duck Plump? That’s suspicious. That’s weird. Freaky.” A full 30-second commercial will address the traditionally male-dominated football industry with a team of other powerful women.</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most laid back: Jeremy Renner for Silk&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In one of the more toned down Super Bowl 2024 ads, Jeremy Renner’s day is transformed by Silk, a plant based milk. The actor launches ingredients across his kitchen as he makes a strawberry smoothie and pancakes while singing James Brown’s “I Got You (I Feel Good).” The actor launches a wooden spoon at a carton of Silk Almond that pours into his surprised daughter's cereal.</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most Adventurous: Glenn Close and Tina Fey for Booking.com&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Super Bowl 2024 commercial from Booking.com opens with comedy legend Tina Fey reclining in an outdoor chair on holiday and scrolling a myriad of choices on the travel app. “With so many choices on Booking.com, there are so many Tinas I could be,” she says. The ad then launches into Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer portraying body doubles Fey has hired to play her alter egos Splurgy Tina and Rustic Tina.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Glenn Close also makes a cameo as Wild Tina, before she takes off her wig and steals one of Fey’s lines.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Most Borrowed: </strong><strong>Snoop Dogg, Martha Stewart, and Willie Nelson for BIC</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a campaign branded “Most Borrowed” Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart—who have long worked together on cooking shows and other commercials—are joined by American country music star Willie Nelson in BIC’s pre-Super Bowl ad. Nelson is on a video call with Snoop and Stewart praising BIC’s EZ reach lighter, which he has borrowed or stolen from the rapper to use in hard to reach places. The ad concludes with Snoop shouting, “I want my big EZ reach lighter back.”&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Funniest: Kate McKinnon for Hellmann’s</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a Hellmann’s mayonnaise ad, actor and comedian Kate McKinnon, former Saturday Night Live (SNL) cast member and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent star of the Barbie movie</a>, makes her cat famous after the feline meows—which sounds like mayo—inspiring McKinnon to make a meal with her leftovers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The cat goes viral, inspiring mayhem in a supermarket and a media frenzy. In one scene, the animal appears on the red carpet with former SNL comedian Pete Davidson in a dig at his revolving dating life, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in another clip,</a> McKinnon struggles to hold jars and the creature during a photo shoot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The cat bears a resemblance to Swift’s feline that the pop star wore on her shoulders in her TIME <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Person of the Year cover </a>shoot—a pose Swifties <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to recreate with difficulty.</a></p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Most nostalgic: Vince Vaughn and Tom Brady for BetMGM&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gambling website BetMGM released its ad with actor Vince Vaughn poking fun at Tom Brady, seven-time Super Bowl champion who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spent 20 seasons as quarterback for the New England Patriots</a>.
