But what about the PM’s own reputation – how has public opinion on the man himself changed over the last 12 months?</p><p data-block-key=3bhj5>On the eve of his accession to 10 Downing Street, public expectations for Rishi Sunak were mixed: 25% expected him to be “good” or “great” as prime minister, 29% “average”, and 29% “poor” or “terrible”.</p><p data-block-key=eg27n>A year into the job, Sunak has not lived up to these limited expectations. Half of Britons say he has been a poor or terrible PM (50%), while just 11% think he has been good or great. A third consider him average (33%), which is the prevailing opinion among Conservative voters, at 48%. Three in ten Tory voters (29%) rate Sunak’s first year in office badly, while 20% think his performance has been positive.</p><h3 data-block-key=7lx5x id="britons-distrust-rishi-sunak's-judgement-across-all-policy-areas-asked-about">Britons distrust Rishi Sunak’s judgement across all policy areas asked about</h3><p data-block-key=fr7oa>Rishi Sunak came to prominence with a promise of economic aptitude. Our previous poll at the time he took office found it was the only issue among 12 on which a clear margin of Britons had confidence in his decision-making, by 50% to 31%.</p><p data-block-key=9589n>That trust has since evaporated, with only 31% placing trust in the PM to effectively manage the economy, while 62% have little to no confidence in him. This represents a 45 point shift in net terms from +14 to -31 – the worst shift across all issues we asked about.</p><p data-block-key=925mr>Sunak’s reputation has taken a hammering across the board though, with net decreases of at least fifteen points in every category. Sunak is least trusted on immigration (75% distrust him), housing (72%), the NHS (72%) and the cost of living (71%). Worryingly for the prime minister, his worst-performing issues cover three of his five ‘pledges’ from the beginning of the year.</p><h3 data-block-key=5oejb id="sunak's-prized-reputation-for-competence-and-decisiveness-has-disappeared">Sunak’s prized reputation for competence and decisiveness has disappeared</h3><p data-block-key=tnte>Rishi Sunak’s pitch to Conservative members at last year’s leadership contest was that he was the candidate of competence. And indeed, as he took office, Britons agreed that he was a competent character, by 50% to 22%.</p><p data-block-key=8vcm2>That prized reputation for competence is now gone, with the public now seeing him as incompetent by 46% to 34%. This represents a 40 point net drop, from +28 to -12.</p><p data-block-key=c86f6>Sunak’s personal reputation is diminished on all fronts, but in no area more than decisiveness. Here he was seen his reputation as a decisive politician go from a net score of +37 to -19 – a 55 point drop.</p><p data-block-key=3dg2q>Belief that Sunak is strong rather than weak has also taken a substantial knock, falling from +15 last year to -35 now.</p><p data-block-key=6j9ir>Currently, the best that can be said for Sunak by the public is that he is not racist (+50) and not lazy (+40).</p><h3 data-block-key=iavq3>Rishi Sunak is still seen as an improvement over Liz Truss and Boris Johnson</h3><p data-block-key=6jg3h>Upon taking over from Liz Truss, 68% of Britons said that they expected Rishi Sunak would be a better prime minister than this short-lived predecessor. One year on, the public still thinks that, although at a diminished rate of 59%.</p><p data-block-key=1ofv4>They still likewise tend to think that Sunak is an improvement on Boris Johnson, with 38% saying so (compared to 41% last year). The number who think he is worse than Johnson has risen slightly, however, from 15% to 22%.</p><p data-block-key=12ioa>Sunak fares less well compared to other prime ministers, however. The public are now torn in a three way split when comparing Rishi Sunak and Theresa May – 30% say May is better, 28% say Sunak is superior, and 31% see them as about the same. In 2022, only 16% had thought Sunak would turn out to be worse than May.</p><p data-block-key=6hs21>Likewise, David Cameron is looking a better PM than Sunak to many Britons. The number saying Cameron is superior to Sunak has increased from 20% to 36%, while at the same time the number who consider Sunak to be the better of the pair has fallen from 25% to 16%.</p><p data-block-key=72bfh>Britons are also more likely to think that Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, John Mayor and Margaret Thatcher were better PMs than Sunak has been than think the opposite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGyDeIWMoaawZZiWwG6%2ByKyfomWjqruit9JmqZ6opamutbXOp2ScoJGjtKawjJqdrZ2iYryvsYyynJqqXZbAbrzM</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f47679-how-has-rishi-sunaks-reputation-changed-after-one-year-as-pm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f47679-how-has-rishi-sunaks-reputation-changed-after-one-year-as-pm.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f47679-how-has-rishi-sunaks-reputation-changed-after-one-year-as-pm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f47679-how-has-rishi-sunaks-reputation-changed-after-one-year-as-pm.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f47679-how-has-rishi-sunaks-reputation-changed-after-one-year-as-pm.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f47679-how-has-rishi-sunaks-reputation-changed-after-one-year-as-pm.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mesures-durgence-en-cas-de-pics-de-pollution-les-deputes-adoptent-la-proposition-de-loi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mesures-durgence-en-cas-de-pics-de-pollution-les-deputes-adoptent-la-proposition-de-loi.html>les dputs adoptent la proposition de loi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./service-minimum-daccueil-des-senateurs-proposent-den-dispenser-les-communes-de-moins-de-2000.html>des snateurs proposent d'en dispenser les communes de moins de 2.000 habitants</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./service-minimum-daccueil-des-senateurs-proposent-den-dispenser-les-communes-de-moins-de-2000.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
