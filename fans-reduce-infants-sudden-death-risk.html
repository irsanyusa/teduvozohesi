But the data suggest that the protective effect applies mostly to babies in poor sleeping environments — those who are put to bed in overheated rooms or on their stomach.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) issued a statement in response to the study, published Oct. 6 in the <i>Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine,</i> warning that “that there is no substitute for the most effective means known to reduce the risk of [sudden infant death syndrome, or] SIDS: always placing infants for sleep on their backs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The NICHD’s federally funded “Back to Sleep” campaign, which advocates for putting babies to sleep face-up, has helped reduce the national SIDS death rate 56%, from 1.2 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1992 to .53 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2003. In addition to placing babies on their backs to sleep, pediatricians recommend that parents use firm mattresses for babies, avoid soft bedding such as comforters and quilts, put babies in their own cribs at night, keep infants from overheating and refrain from smoking during pregnancy and infancy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Indeed, the study’s authors say that caretakers who followed established safety guidelines were less likely overall to suffer the sudden death of a child, compared with those who tended not to take the same precautions. The study also found that when fans were used in the absence of other environmental risk factors — that is, when parents already had other safeguards in place — it had no significant additional impact on the risk of SIDS.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If the baby was already in a good sleeping environment, there wasn’t very much chance they were ‘rebreathing,'” says Dr. De-Kun Li of Kaiser Permanente’s Division of Research and a co-author of the study, referring to the re-inhalation of carbon dioxide that is associated with sudden unexplained death. “So it’s not surprising that adding a fan, or not, didn’t make that much difference.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The benefit of a fan became apparent, however, when it was used in sleep environments typically associated with a higher risk of SIDS. For example, researchers found that fans were associated with a 94% reduction in SIDS risk for babies who slept in rooms that exceeded 70 degrees F (21 degrees C); an 85% reduction for infants in rooms with closed windows; an 86% reduction among babies placed on their sides or stomach to sleep; and a 78% reduction among those who did not use a pacifier (the pacifier’s handle is hypothesized to help maintain babies’ breathing space under a blanket or in soft bedding).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If you decrease the chance of rebreathing exhaled air, your SIDS rate is going to be reduced, says Li. “Using a fan is one way.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Betty McEntire, executive director of the American SIDS Institute, says the study is useful for underscoring the link between SIDS and rebreathing or overheating. “We know that increased carbon dioxide can hurt the baby’s ability to arouse during sleep,” says McEntire. “So you definitely want to prevent your baby from rebreathing and overheating.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Chipping away at the SIDS problem is important,” McEntire continues, “and this study adds a little bit [of clarity] to the puzzle.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The etiology of SIDS is still largely a mystery. To date, perhaps the best evidence of its cause comes from a 2006 study led by researchers at Children’s Hospital Boston, who examined the brain tissue of babies who died from SIDS and those who died from other causes. Researchers found that SIDS babies often have a brain defect in a region of the brain that controls breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. The abnormality appears to weaken the responsiveness of certain functions, including arousal from sleep when the body fails to get enough oxygen. Researchers think the defect may be genetic in origin, although there are no biological tests yet to determine risk.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For now, the study’s authors agree that the best way to reduce the likelihood of SIDS — the leading cause of death among American infants aged under 1 year, which kills more than 2,000 infants each year — is through environmental safety measures put forth by the <a href=# rel=noopener>American Academy of Pediatrics</a>. Using a fan, Li says, “can provide concerned parents an extra measure to reduce SIDS.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9wbGpobINwssCnqmaqlZnCpLGMoqWfmZ6pwG6%2F1J2bnqZdmbKiwMdmqaKrm2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffans-reduce-infants-sudden-death-risk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffans-reduce-infants-sudden-death-risk.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffans-reduce-infants-sudden-death-risk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffans-reduce-infants-sudden-death-risk.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffans-reduce-infants-sudden-death-risk.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffans-reduce-infants-sudden-death-risk.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./guess-the-celebrity-only-people-with-perfect-facial-recognition-can-nail-this-quiz-818288.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./guess-the-celebrity-only-people-with-perfect-facial-recognition-can-nail-this-quiz-818288.html>Guess the Celebrity: Only People With Perfect Facial Recognition Can Nail This Quiz</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bbnaijas-frodd-ties-knot-with-lover-in-low-key-ceremony.html>BBNaija's Frodd ties knot with lover in low key ceremony</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bbnaijas-frodd-ties-knot-with-lover-in-low-key-ceremony.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
