<time>26 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><span class="leading-7 float-left border-t-2 border-l-2 border-solid border-time-red text-5xl py-2 pr-0.5 pl-[0.3125rem] my-0.5 mr-2.5 font-zilla-slab">T</span>he newspaper ad shows up in the second episode of Ava DuVernay’s new Netflix drama <a href=#>When They See Us.</a> It’s a full-page proclamation, headlined in capital letters: “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like the rest of the series, this ad is taken from the real story of the Central Park jogger case — the rape and beating of jogger Trisha Meili on April 19, 1989 — and the subsequent consequences for the Central Park Five, the teen suspects whose lives were upended in the more than a decade that passed between the event and their eventual exoneration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And the history the series draws from isn’t just a matter of things that happened 30 years ago: in real life as in the show, the person who spent $85,000 placing the ads in local papers was Donald Trump.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump, at the time a real estate developer, wasn’t the first to draw attention to the case. The horrific Central Park attack on a 28-year-old woman, a white investment banker with degrees from Wellesley and Yale, quickly made local news. As part of a police investigation into “a larger rampage in which several people were randomly attacked in the park that night” by teens who were “wilding,” as <a href=#>TIME later reported,</a> police picked up several suspects who were in roughly the same area of the park around the time of the attack. They were a group of African American and Hispanic teens named Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise, who became known collectively as the Central Park Five.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But though the news was already making headlines, Trump’s ad, which ran in local papers less than two weeks after the incident, played a key role in shaping public opinion about the case.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His open letter mourned how New York families of all races “have had to give up the pleasure of a leisurely stroll in the Park at Dusk” because of “roving thousands of wild criminals.” He argued that politicians were overly concerned with public outcry about police brutality — such as the fatal shooting of<a href=# rel=noopener> a disabled elderly black woman</a> by a NYPD officer in the mid-1980s — to the point that they weren’t letting the “neighborhood cop” do his job of protecting the community, creating a “reckless and dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a helpless woman.” He said “these muggers and murderers…should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Michael Warren, a member of the Central Park Five legal team, <a href=# rel=noopener>argued in The Guardian in 2016</a> that Trump “poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/trump-central-park-five-ads.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Ava DuVernay recently told <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a>, “[The suspects’ mothers] knew what a threat it was, the violence that Trump was basically inciting upon these boys. But the men themselves, when I asked them, they really didn’t have much of a memory [of Trump in 1989]; at the time, he was the guy with gold buildings. Just a white dude on the other side of the park.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While four had given video confessions, they later said those had been coerced and all maintained their innocence. (Studies have <a href=# rel=noopener>shown</a> that false confessions are a particular problem with young suspects.) There were also notable <a href=#>inconsistencies</a> in their statements and other eyewitness accounts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, two juries convicted the five in 1990. They served prison sentences ranging from six years to 13 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Dec. 19. 2002, the convictions of the five men were <a href=# rel=noopener>vacated</a> after a man named Matias Reyes, whose DNA matched evidence from the crime, confessed to having been responsible. The police department <a href=# rel=noopener>has said</a> it still believes the men were involved in some way and the victim, Meili, <a href=# rel=noopener>has said</a> that she wishes the case had gone back to court because she still believes more than one person was responsible, but the city <a href=# rel=noopener>settled</a> with the five in 2014, giving each roughly $1 million for each year spent behind bars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even after the exonerations, Trump has continued to maintain that the five men had been criminals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2013, he tweeted that a 2012 documentary film called The Central Park Five, made by Ken Burns and his daughter Sarah Burns, “didn’t explain the horrific crimes of these young men while in the park.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Central Park Five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.horrific crimes of these young men while in park</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>April 24, 2013</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Mr. Trump is apparently ignorant of our country’s epidemic of wrongful convictions, which disproportionately affect minorities, and the prevalence of false confessions in those convictions,” Sarah Burns later <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a> in the New York Times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump called the more than <a href=# rel=noopener>$40 million settlement</a> that the five men worked out with New York City a “disgrace,” writing in a<a href=# rel=noopener> June 2014 op-ed</a> for the New York Daily News, “What about the other people who were brutalized that night, in addition to the jogger?…These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.” <a href=# rel=noopener>None of the five had been arrested before</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since then, he has repeatedly reiterated the guilty verdict of the men, even though their convictions were vacated. “They admitted they were guilty,” the then-candidate <a href=#>said</a> in a <a href=# rel=noopener>CNN</a> interview the month before the 2016 election. “The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just this week, when President Trump argued on Twitter on May 27 that African Americans won’t vote for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who supported the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a law that experts say has contributed to the <a href=#>mass incarceration</a> of black people, DuVernay fired back that Trump himself had played a big role in creating the atmosphere that made its passage possible.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>May 27, 2019</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“[The Central Park Five] were innocent,” the filmmaker wrote. “And they will have the last word.” When They See Us, which is <a href=# rel=noopener>based on interviews </a>with the real Central Park Five, is DuVernay’s attempt to let those men do just that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWlshXV%2Fjpycp6yilrluvMCromaemauybsDRrqSpZZiewLW70bJm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcentral-park-five-trump-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcentral-park-five-trump-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcentral-park-five-trump-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcentral-park-five-trump-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcentral-park-five-trump-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcentral-park-five-trump-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./un-projet-de-loi-pour-affirmer-lattachement-du-gouvernement-au-statut.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./un-projet-de-loi-pour-affirmer-lattachement-du-gouvernement-au-statut.html>Un projet de loi pour affirmer &amp;quot;l'attachement&amp;quot; du gouvernement au statut</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-20-greatest-movies-according-to-quentin-tarantino-102205.html>The 20greatest movies according toQuentin Tarantino</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-20-greatest-movies-according-to-quentin-tarantino-102205.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
