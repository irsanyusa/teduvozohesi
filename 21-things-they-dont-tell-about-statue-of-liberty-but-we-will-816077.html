A&nbsp;bronze replica of&nbsp;its little sister that served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model for the&nbsp;<a href=# title=NY data-link=tag>NY</a> statue stands in&nbsp;the Jardin du&nbsp;Luxembourg in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>. A&nbsp;quarter-scale replica of&nbsp;the iconic monument is&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;island in&nbsp;the Seine River, also in&nbsp;Paris. There is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;life-size gold-leaf-covered copy of&nbsp;the torch on&nbsp;the entrance to&nbsp;a&nbsp;world-famous tunnel in&nbsp;Paris.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;New York, if&nbsp;you look very closely at&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;Lady Liberty, you can clearly see that the famous statue was inspired by&nbsp;none other than the 50s pop star <a href=# title="Elvis Presley" data-link=tag>Elvis Presley</a>... No, I’m just messing with you. The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was designed by&nbsp;Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi 60&nbsp;years before Elvis was even born. People have different opinions about who really inspired the face of&nbsp;Lady Liberty. According to&nbsp;one theory, the model for her was the beautiful Isabella Boyer. Isabella was born in&nbsp;1841 to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wealthy family in&nbsp;Paris. When she turned&nbsp;22, she moved to&nbsp;New York to&nbsp;marry an&nbsp;American entrepreneur and became a&nbsp;socialite. Yeah.</p><p>The real unglamorous story is&nbsp;Bartholdi modeled the face after his mother. Who, I&nbsp;guess Elvis looked like. Another theory that suggests that Lady Liberty might not be&nbsp;modeled after a&nbsp;western white woman as&nbsp;previously thought. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;young man, Bartholdi went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a> and after seeing the pyramids, he&nbsp;was inspired to&nbsp;create colossal sculptures. Older and more successful, Bartholdi returned to&nbsp;Egypt to&nbsp;propose a&nbsp;new sculpture at&nbsp;the entrance of&nbsp;the Suez Canal. The sculpture was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called “Egypt Carrying the Light to&nbsp;Asia” and depicted a&nbsp;cloaked figure holding a&nbsp;torch to&nbsp;guide travelers through the canal. Well, that one cost too much, but he&nbsp;kept the idea in&nbsp;his head until another opportunity arose in&nbsp;New York Harbor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a89/56c/c794515adc96aeb297c872feed.jpeg><p>This is&nbsp;what this statue looked like 135 years ago. Yes, its color is&nbsp;very different. It’s the same color you’d see if&nbsp;you cut through an&nbsp;electrical wire. Because the entire outside of&nbsp;the statue is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;copper. About 20&nbsp;years after it&nbsp;was installed, it&nbsp;turned completely green. That’s because the air and the frequent rains gradually oxidized the metal, called patina. And that metal is&nbsp;extremely thin. Designers could’ve made those sheets of&nbsp;metal thicker, but then the statue would’ve been even heavier, and it&nbsp;would’ve fallen under its own weight. A&nbsp;little thinner and the severe oxidation and corrosion of&nbsp;the metal would’ve made holes in&nbsp;the statue.</p><p>The sculptor had thought well about the construction of&nbsp;the statue, and it&nbsp;took more than 10&nbsp;years to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it. But it&nbsp;all started with this model, made of&nbsp;clay. It&nbsp;was only 4&nbsp;feet tall. So&nbsp;you would probably be&nbsp;taller than this mini Statue of&nbsp;Liberty, even with its arm raised. The next model was made of&nbsp;plaster. By&nbsp;increasing the size, the sculptor could add and refine the details of&nbsp;the statue. For example, a&nbsp;detail that you would never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see from Liberty island or&nbsp;even from the pedestal. It’s the shackles by&nbsp;her ankles. It&nbsp;looks as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she has thrown them off, symbolizing freedom.</p><p>The next model was 33&nbsp;feet tall, or&nbsp;the length of&nbsp;a&nbsp;school bus. That’s about a&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;the statue’s actual size. And it&nbsp;was the maximum size the sculptor could fit in&nbsp;his workshop. Then the sculptor proceeded to&nbsp;create the full-size pieces&nbsp;— the head and the hand holding the torch. The other hand held a&nbsp;stone tablet with Roman numerals embossed on&nbsp;it, signifying July&nbsp;4, 1776, the date of&nbsp;American Independence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f4e/f5f/3def2b5c87829fa9b2594d3d70.jpeg><p>So&nbsp;it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;build the final version of&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. The constructors needed all the parts of&nbsp;the statue made of&nbsp;plaster first. Here’s its head. They took sheets of&nbsp;wood parallel to&nbsp;each other and pushed them against the model. The edges of&nbsp;the sheets were then shaped so&nbsp;that they perfectly replicated the shapes and curves of&nbsp;the statue. In&nbsp;other words, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;mold. Then, the wooden structure was placed on&nbsp;the floor and covered with a&nbsp;sheet of&nbsp;copper the thickness of&nbsp;a&nbsp;penny. All that was left was to&nbsp;carefully shape the sheet of&nbsp;copper into the curves of&nbsp;the statue with soft wooden mallets and a&nbsp;press.</p><p>The statue and pedestal together cost $500,000 to&nbsp;build. French supporters raised funds to&nbsp;build the statue, and Americans paid for the pedestal it&nbsp;would stand&nbsp;on. In&nbsp;today’s money that would be&nbsp;over $10&nbsp;million. The statue was completed in&nbsp;France and then shipped to&nbsp;America, packed in&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;wooden crates.</p><p>Over 200,000 Americans waited to&nbsp;greet the ship carrying Lady Liberty as&nbsp;it&nbsp;arrived in&nbsp;New York Harbor. The statue was assembled in&nbsp;four months on&nbsp;Bedloe’s Island which is&nbsp;now known as&nbsp;Liberty Island. A&nbsp;mistake might’ve been made when the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was assembled. During an&nbsp;inspection in&nbsp;1982, workers realized that her head had been installed two feet off-center.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/4b2/44f/bd68be59ddac6370161108e25d.jpeg><p>Shortly down the road in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;this famous Paris tunnel is&nbsp;the Flame of&nbsp;Liberty. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-sized replica of&nbsp;the flame from Lady Liberty’s torch covered in&nbsp;gold leaf. This monument was gifted to&nbsp;France in&nbsp;1989 by&nbsp;donors across the world as&nbsp;a&nbsp;thank you for the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;the Franco-American friendship. About&nbsp;4.5 million people visit the famous statue every year. By&nbsp;comparison, around 3.75 million people visit the London Eye each year. This makes the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty one of&nbsp;the most popular tourist attractions in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>Almost 100 years after the statue was erected, Lady Liberty’s torch was given a&nbsp;makeover. In&nbsp;1984, the statue’s original copper and glass torch was replaced with a&nbsp;new one covered in&nbsp;24-karat gold leaf. The torch is&nbsp;the only place not accessible to&nbsp;visitors due to&nbsp;damage it&nbsp;previously sustained, making it&nbsp;unsafe to&nbsp;climb up&nbsp;there.</p><p>The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty is&nbsp;150 feet tall. It’s like 10&nbsp;giraffes sitting on&nbsp;each other’s necks. Compared to&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person, you’d have to&nbsp;stand on&nbsp;the shoulders of&nbsp;your 25&nbsp;friends to&nbsp;reach the torch in&nbsp;its right hand. The concrete base and pedestal make the statue even taller, 305 feet from the ground to&nbsp;the very top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fa3/dc6/af726759d8bd5a8d5e256bf1d2.jpeg><p>So, let’s get inside the thing. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through the doors of&nbsp;a&nbsp;star-shaped base. Then you have a&nbsp;choice: take the elevator up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the observation deck or&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;the 192&nbsp;steps. You go&nbsp;first. There are stairs for tourists to&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;and another staircase to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down to&nbsp;avoid the crowds and traffic. The stairs take you to&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;a&nbsp;six-story building, right up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the observation deck, at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the pedestal.</p><p>To&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the crown of&nbsp;the statue, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the 7th floor, where we&nbsp;see a&nbsp;double helix stairway. It&nbsp;runs right inside the iron pylons, the spine of&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty, designed by&nbsp;none other than Gustave Eiffel, you know, the Eiffel Tower guy. This stairway is&nbsp;double because there’s one side for going up&nbsp;and the other for going down. There’s also some space where you can rest if&nbsp;you get tired while going&nbsp;up. Yeah, I’ve done&nbsp;it, and yes you need&nbsp;it. And you need reservations.</p><p>As&nbsp;you climb the Statue, you can see exactly how the 300 copper sheets were attached to&nbsp;the metal frame. The story of&nbsp;how exactly they did that is&nbsp;riveting. Ha. And you can also distinguish specific details of&nbsp;the statue, like the folds of&nbsp;the dress and even locks of&nbsp;hair.&nbsp;354 steps done, congratulations, you’ve reached the observation deck in&nbsp;the crown of&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. It’s pretty cozy up&nbsp;there, and only fits a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;people. You can peer out over New York Harbor through 25&nbsp;glass windows. They symbolize the gems of&nbsp;our planet. And there are powerful lanterns behind you that light up&nbsp;the glass. They turn on&nbsp;at&nbsp;night, so&nbsp;that passing ships can see the Statue’s crown glow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/4d0/84c/50e21a5474af1fe0d31f1f353d.jpeg><p>Entry to&nbsp;the torch is&nbsp;not allowed for tourists, but just for you, we’ll open it&nbsp;up&nbsp;for a&nbsp;minute. To&nbsp;get up&nbsp;there... you have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down. Yes, about to&nbsp;the neck of&nbsp;the statue. There’s a&nbsp;hatch that leads through a&nbsp;narrow passage into the right arm of&nbsp;the statue. Then you have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;the stairs to&nbsp;the wrist. And then another ladder will lead you to&nbsp;the handle of&nbsp;the torch.</p><p>Open the cylindrical door, and oh-my! You’re on&nbsp;the highest observation deck of&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. For many years now, only workers have been allowed access here. Back at&nbsp;the beginning, this arm stood separately in&nbsp;Madison Square Park for 6&nbsp;years to&nbsp;draw attention to&nbsp;that campaign until the funding issues were resolved.</p><p>And, before it&nbsp;even made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, its head had been on&nbsp;display at&nbsp;the World’s Fair in&nbsp;Paris to&nbsp;help raise money for the project. The Statue’s lamp was to&nbsp;originally serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighthouse beacon, but it&nbsp;was not bright enough (just like&nbsp;me) and the light could barely make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Manhattan. Sculptor Bartholdi offered to&nbsp;cover the entire statue in&nbsp;gold to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;brighter. That idea would have been crazy expensive, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was never brought to&nbsp;life. The original spikes above its head got rusty so&nbsp;what you see now was added way later.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9yedOhoKefo2LBqbHYZpuopqRiwaa4y2aYm6elqXq0wMCtrJ5ln5t6rbXBnqmtsV2XwrV51p5ksKGcoXp5fZVpbnBn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f21-things-they-dont-tell-about-statue-of-liberty-but-we-will-816077.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f21-things-they-dont-tell-about-statue-of-liberty-but-we-will-816077.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f21-things-they-dont-tell-about-statue-of-liberty-but-we-will-816077.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f21-things-they-dont-tell-about-statue-of-liberty-but-we-will-816077.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f21-things-they-dont-tell-about-statue-of-liberty-but-we-will-816077.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f21-things-they-dont-tell-about-statue-of-liberty-but-we-will-816077.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./13005-british-jobs-meaningless.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./13005-british-jobs-meaningless.html>37% of British workers think their jobs are meaningless</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vers-un-plan-dactions-pour-la-renovation-des-residences-de-tourisme.html>Vers un plan d'actions pour la rnovation des rsidences de tourisme</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vers-un-plan-dactions-pour-la-renovation-des-residences-de-tourisme.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
