<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Amongst the swamps lives a&nbsp;strange bird with a&nbsp;Dutch clog for a&nbsp;beak. It&nbsp;screeches a&nbsp;high pitch whine, notifying other shoebills that this is&nbsp;its area when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;<a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a>. Its eerie calls add to&nbsp;the surrounding roars of&nbsp;dinosaurs in&nbsp;the distance. It’s not hunting dinosaurs, though, of&nbsp;course, but snakes, <a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a>, lizards, and frogs amongst the reeds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/647/751/73dd0f573a9292d07e48120a90.png><p>This bird continued to&nbsp;survive even as&nbsp;the dinosaurs left this world. Fossil records of&nbsp;the Shoebill date back to&nbsp;65,000,000 years ago! And today, it&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;hunt in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar environment. Although once widespread, today, its restricted habitat is&nbsp;within several countries in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Africa data-link=tag>Africa</a>. The shoebill stands up&nbsp;to&nbsp;60&nbsp;in&nbsp;tall, and its broad <a href=# title=wings data-link=tag>wings</a> are built for soaring across the plains.</p><p>But the main feature of&nbsp;the shoebill&nbsp;is, of&nbsp;course, its beak. Ancient in&nbsp;appearance, it’s gone unchanged for ages. Its huge bulging bill measures up&nbsp;to&nbsp;9&nbsp;in, which makes it&nbsp;the third-largest among all living birds. The upper mandible of&nbsp;the beak ends with a&nbsp;sharp nail, perfect for its prey. It&nbsp;lets the bird take them out with an&nbsp;instant peck.</p><p>With a&nbsp;wide range of&nbsp;food at&nbsp;its disposal, it’s known as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most terrifying birds. Its hunting behavior is&nbsp;still as&nbsp;effective as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was millions of&nbsp;years ago, which has made its survival possible. It&nbsp;feeds mainly on&nbsp;aquatic animals, fish, frogs, lizards, and even small crocodiles! So, there’s always been plenty of&nbsp;options at&nbsp;its own “all-you-can-eat buffet”.</p><p>Surprisingly, their relationship with humans is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty chill one. That’s why they’re so&nbsp;popular among birdwatchers. This cool guy is&nbsp;just standing idle, staring down the lens, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;to&nbsp;say, “I’ve seen a&nbsp;lot worse than you!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cb2/abe/86726a5d73b464ed7d811e1f15.png><p>Lurking under the water in&nbsp;many countries around the world, another opportunistic hunter lays low beneath the shallows. Meet the Saltwater crocodile! With an&nbsp;appearance that just straight-up tells you it’s ancient, it’s been around for over 240,000,000&nbsp;years. Once appearing a&nbsp;lot larger, they’ve always had a&nbsp;reputation for taking down whatever came too close, even dinosaurs!</p><p>They survived many catastrophic events and have continued to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;each of&nbsp;them. As&nbsp;they continued to&nbsp;evolve, they’ve become the ultimate survivalists as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know them today. Still, they sit within their territory, waiting for anything to&nbsp;enter, even humans. They grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;20&nbsp;ft and have a&nbsp;powerful bite that’s stronger than any other animal.&nbsp;30&nbsp;times stronger than YOUR bite, just saying!</p><p>Anything that ends up&nbsp;in&nbsp;its toothy cage cannot escape. With scales and armor plates protecting&nbsp;it, there isn’t an&nbsp;animal on&nbsp;Earth that hunts&nbsp;it, making the crocodile the ultimate apex predator. As&nbsp;per its name, it&nbsp;also adapted to&nbsp;saltwater, providing it&nbsp;with useful salt glands, something its alligator cousins don’t have. And that’s how they’re able to&nbsp;swim enormous lengths out to&nbsp;sea.</p><p>Their routes follow ocean currents, and they aren’t afraid of&nbsp;bypassing the shark-infested waters. Not even the great white would mess with this one! The distances they’ve traveled measure up&nbsp;to&nbsp;390&nbsp;miles, and they’re capable of&nbsp;reaching speeds up&nbsp;to&nbsp;18&nbsp;mph. Just another reason not to&nbsp;swim in&nbsp;the sea&nbsp;— right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1f0/ede/0114b35efe8201856973ce465c.png><p>The next creature on&nbsp;our list has been around for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;145,000,000&nbsp;years. These pesky little things have been feeding off warm-bodied animals. Can you guess what I’m talking about? Lice! Those guys originated in&nbsp;the cretaceous period [between 145.5 and 65.5 million years ago] when they used to&nbsp;feed on&nbsp;dinosaurs once upon a&nbsp;time.</p><p>And then, they have continued to&nbsp;remain a&nbsp;constant annoyance to&nbsp;most species. Currently, there are 5,000 different species of&nbsp;lice, each one having a&nbsp;taste for a&nbsp;different animal. They feed on&nbsp;all birds and mammals, except for pangolins and bats. Hmmmmm, lucky them.</p><p>They are an&nbsp;“obligate parasite,” which means they cannot live unless they live off another life form. Living their entire lives to&nbsp;reproduce on&nbsp;their “hosts”, lice will change their color to&nbsp;match the fur or&nbsp;feather of&nbsp;their new homeland. But how do&nbsp;you get lice as&nbsp;a&nbsp;human?</p><p>Well, it’s purely by&nbsp;luck or&nbsp;bad luck. They usually choose to&nbsp;leave when their original host has passed&nbsp;on. They seek a&nbsp;free flight from a&nbsp;nearby fly, grabbing onto its legs and hitching a&nbsp;ride to&nbsp;the new homeland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d47/765/b3fd705832823bb6d1f09a5c4a.png><p>Within 4&nbsp;small islands in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Indonesia data-link=tag>Indonesia</a> lives a&nbsp;powerful beast, a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;the megafauna period. Meet the Komodo dragon! Reaching a&nbsp;length up&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;ft, it’s a&nbsp;master ambusher. Its hunting method involves tracking down prey, then injecting <a href=# title=venom data-link=tag>venom</a> into&nbsp;it.</p><p>As&nbsp;the prey escapes, it&nbsp;will track it&nbsp;down as&nbsp;it&nbsp;slowly tires and then feeds on&nbsp;it. And that’s how it’s managed to&nbsp;survive for millions of&nbsp;years. But it&nbsp;has strangely disappeared from other parts of&nbsp;the world. These islands weren’t always its home, and it’s only been here for the past 4,000,000&nbsp;years.</p><p>Originally, the dragon’s ancestors came from Asia but migrated south to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>&nbsp;40,000,000 years ago. And with a&nbsp;great range and variety of&nbsp;food, that’s where they grew to&nbsp;their massive size. Then some 25,000,000 years later, a&nbsp;collision with continental landmasses occurred between Australia and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Taking the opportunity, they spread even further, as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;East Timor. As&nbsp;the islands became separated, the Komodo dragons continued to&nbsp;flourish in&nbsp;their new lands. Without any competition, they could maintain their normal hunting methods. Unfortunately, in&nbsp;Australia, they all eventually disappeared due to&nbsp;competition from humans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f77/10d/064c6e57248f7be8be3ccad5eb.png><p>Another ancient species is&nbsp;really intriguing, not only because of&nbsp;its appearance. Let me&nbsp;introduce to&nbsp;you&nbsp;— the Coelacanths. Scientists found the only evidence of&nbsp;their existence in&nbsp;their fossils. It&nbsp;made&nbsp;us believe they disappeared 410,000,000 years ago. So, you could imagine the surprise when they were discovered in&nbsp;1938, idly swimming along the east coast of&nbsp;South Africa.</p><p>It’s truly a&nbsp;fossil that’s come back to&nbsp;life. It&nbsp;gave&nbsp;us a&nbsp;great opportunity to&nbsp;not only further understand this species but to&nbsp;answer many questions about some of&nbsp;its relatives. Growing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;ft, they have a&nbsp;lifespan of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;100&nbsp;years. But what’s strange is&nbsp;they have 8&nbsp;fins! They’re the oldest known living member of&nbsp;the lobe-finned fish.</p><p>They are so&nbsp;ancient that they’re more related to&nbsp;amphibians, reptiles, birds, and even mammals than to&nbsp;the ray-finned fish we&nbsp;know. Armored with strong Cosmoid scales and with a&nbsp;hinge on&nbsp;their jaw that allows them to&nbsp;open their mouth very wide, they are truly ancient-looking creatures. But they did evolve slightly differently than their ancestors, although they still look the same.</p><p>They once lived in&nbsp;much shallower waters and originally used lungs to&nbsp;breathe. After the Dinosaur age, they had to&nbsp;move into deeper waters to&nbsp;feed and gradually upgraded their lungs to&nbsp;gills. And it&nbsp;was this new ability that ensured their survival.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7f0/49b/5f7b7e5aaeb84cba02ccfd9e1f.png><p>Let’s go&nbsp;even further back to&nbsp;480,000,000 years ago. You wouldn’t think that anything that existed back then could possibly still be&nbsp;alive today. But the Horseshoe crab is&nbsp;not only still on&nbsp;this planet&nbsp;— it’s almost identical to&nbsp;its ancestors. Its whole body is&nbsp;protected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;thick plate with spikes pointing outwards.</p><p>It&nbsp;has 10&nbsp;eyes scattered around the body.&nbsp;2&nbsp;are used for finding mates, and the remaining 8&nbsp;act as&nbsp;light receptors. There is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;long tail. Although it&nbsp;looks menacing, its only use is&nbsp;to&nbsp;simply help flip itself back the right way up&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets knocked over. Its design is&nbsp;so&nbsp;effective that whatever constant changes the planet has provided, it&nbsp;survived.</p><p>Although they look like they could be&nbsp;related to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lobster, they’re actually closer to&nbsp;spiders and scorpions than crabs or&nbsp;crustaceans. With a&nbsp;healthy diet of&nbsp;clams, crustaceans, and worms, they find enough to&nbsp;eat along the coasts of&nbsp;the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.</p><p>They also feed on&nbsp;algae, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes sense why they managed to&nbsp;survive many food shortages caused by&nbsp;world events. With all the traits of&nbsp;the horseshoe crab, who knows, it&nbsp;might even outlive humans! Well, here’s to&nbsp;the next 480,000,000&nbsp;years!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZINuvNGen6KrpKS%2Fqq%2BMmqWipZGhwG7Ax5qrZpmimnq0u8yen6ivXajBqrjLZpirp6WjsW6EkG1sbHFf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f6-prehistoric-animals-that-are-somehow-still-around-814539.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f6-prehistoric-animals-that-are-somehow-still-around-814539.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f6-prehistoric-animals-that-are-somehow-still-around-814539.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f6-prehistoric-animals-that-are-somehow-still-around-814539.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f6-prehistoric-animals-that-are-somehow-still-around-814539.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f6-prehistoric-animals-that-are-somehow-still-around-814539.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./auto-racing-barrier-deaths.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./auto-racing-barrier-deaths.html>Driver Safety in Car Racing Must Be a Top Priority</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-actors-who-turned-down-roles-of-a-lifetime-that-couldve-changed-their-careers-798289.html>15 Actors Who Turned Down Roles of a Lifetime That Couldve Changed Their Careers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-actors-who-turned-down-roles-of-a-lifetime-that-couldve-changed-their-careers-798289.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
